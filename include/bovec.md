### Places to Eat and Stay

* We loved staying at [Holiday House Natura](http://www.bovechouse.com/) and [Chalet GoSlo](https://www.thinkslovenia.com/holiday-rentals/chalet-goslo).
* Getting good food in Bovec became harder since Dobra Vila restaurant closed down. [Sovdat](https://www.gostiscesovdat.com/en/) is the best option, Letni Vrt is not bad. Stay away from Martinov Hram unless you admire haughty waiters (see Google reviews for more details)
* We stopped by Metoja (in Soƒça village) once and it was an excellent choice. So was Topli Val in Kobarid.
