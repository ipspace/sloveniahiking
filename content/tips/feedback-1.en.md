A friend of mine wanted to spend a week in Slovenia. I gave him a few recommendations, and he had a great time. Here's what he sent me after getting back home.

From all my travels in Europe I have never seen anything like Slovenia.

Everyone speaks better English than me living in the US, the highways, the traffic organization, the level of industry you feel present, of course the food, the wine, the people. What a wonderful place.

Tiny country, Bled, very idyllic and pretty but "touristy" as well, Kranjska Gora was beautiful, so quiet and nature oriented, We saw little kids taken in excursions to the mountain, walking on the fields in the early morning, I wish my kids would have had that upbringing, Lake Bohinj, Savica waterfall, the entire area was one of our favorites, did not have enough time to see more. Some other time I will go back to that area and do the 2 - 3 hour trails.

Vipava valley what a beauty, the contrast in autumn of the fields and the forest, the weather, truly incredible.

We went to Udine in Italy one day, it was fine but the authenticity of Slovenia is unique.

Piran/Izola very nice, very safe, little sea towns, quiet too, found myself one morning sitting by the street that borders the sea having a coffee and thinking that I was in the best possible place I could be at that moment.

Needless to say, food and wine were incredible. The people were so friendly and nice all over, so knowledgeable and intelligent.
