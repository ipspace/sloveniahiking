Got this question from a good friend of mine:

> What would be your favorite hike in the Karst area? We're going to stay a couple of days at the [St. Daniel](https://www.stdaniel.si/) hotel, and plan to explore Štanjel and Škrbina. Any other ideas?

I mainly bike across Karst, but you'll also [find a few hiking ideas](https://sloveniahiking.rocks/en/region/karst-plateau/) on my website. VisitKras.info has [further suggestions](https://www.visitkras.info/en/things-to-do/hiking/).

Starting with short hikes close to Štanjel, so you can hike straight from the hotel:

* [Fabiani Trail](https://www.visitkras.info/en/fabiani-trail)
* [Trail of Nine Ponds](https://sloveniahiking.rocks/en/biking/path9ponds/)
* [The Karst of the Dwarfs Trail](https://www.visitkras.info/en/the-karst-of-the-dwarfs-fairy-experiential-trail)
* You could also do parts of the [Spacal Trail](https://www.visitkras.info/en/spacal-trail)

Most of these trails follow gravel roads or dirt trails. All of those trails should be on the free maps you get with Outdooractive (or a similar app), so you'll never get lost.

The [Pliska Trail](https://www.visitkras.info/en/pliska-trail) is also nice, but a bit further away. In theory, you could walk to Pliskovica from the hotel (I did it once).

However, if you're looking for great views, you have to go either to the edge of the Karst plateau or beyond:

* [Cerje](https://sloveniahiking.rocks/en/hikes/cerje/)
* Trstelj (easy marked path from Lipa)
* [Kokoš](https://sloveniahiking.rocks/en/hikes/kokos/)
* [Upper Karst above Trieste](https://sloveniahiking.rocks/en/hikes/zgornjikras/)
* [From Osp to Socerb](https://sloveniahiking.rocks/en/hikes/socerb/)

There are also numerous trails in the [Glinščica](https://www.visitkras.info/en/vertical-in-the-glinscica-valley) (Val Rosandra) valley. Park at the Val Rosandra reception center and explore.
