## Notes

* The gravel road to Saint Jacob is technically closed to all traffic. I could never figure out whether that applies to biking, and it seems like the local bikers don’t think so. In any case, if you encounter someone with different opinions, don’t argue with them and never tell them I said it’s OK - I did not.
* You could [park next to Castle Turn](/en/hikes/svjakob_preddvor). I prefer to park close to the main road (see *starting coordinates*) and leave those parking spots to hikers.
* Follow the signs for *sv. Jakob*. At the junction where you have to choose between a wide footpath and a gravel road, choose the latter.
