description: Mala Lazna is a lovely clearing deep in the Trnovo Forest. A chance geological
  accident resulted in an unusual soil composition welcoming plants you would not
  find anywhere else in western Slovenia. You can reach Mala Lazna via an asphalt
  road from Predmeja to Lokve, making it a perfect destination for a short road biking
  trip.
