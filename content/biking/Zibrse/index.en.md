  Rovte hills. You'll enjoy fantastic views while exploring them, and you might be
  lucky enough to stumble upon a rare wildflower in late May or early June.

### Starting Point

* I decided to drive to the point where the road for Medvedje Brdo forks off the main road Logatec-Rovte (see *starting point* for coordinates).
* You could start at [Logatec castle](https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slika:Logatec_Castle.jpg) and follow the signs for Logaške Žibrše.

### Navigation Notes

* Follow the signs for Pr Mihevc farm and L036 bike path to find the uphill asphalt road toward Logaške Žibrše.
* Asphalt turns into a gravel road above the farm. At the next T-junction, turn right if you're interested in rare wildflowers (*Drosera* grows in the valley you'd bike through), or left (as I did) if you prefer great views.
* Just before the gravel road turns back into an asphalt one, turn right onto a narrower road.
* When you reach a farm on your right, keep going straight, following hiking waymarks toward Ravnik.
* At the next junction, turn right.
* After reaching another asphalt road, turn right and descend toward Hotedrščica. You might want to stop at that junction, chain the bike to a fence, and walk to the church of St. Barbara.
* After reaching the main road Logatec-Idrija in Hotedrščica, turn right toward Žejna Dolina just before the Turk inn.
* The road turns back into a gravel road after the last houses in Hotedrščica. Follow it to Rovtarske Žibrše.
* In Rovtarske Žibrše, turn left if you feel like having a pizza (or lunch) in [Tavžentroža](zaplanatavzentroza), or right if you're in a hurry to get back.

### Rare Wildflowers

I mentioned rare wildflowers in the introduction. You'll be biking close to marshy meadows. Watch out for *[Gladiolus palustris](../../flowers/gladioluspalustris/)*, *[Drosera anglica](../../flowers/droseraanglica/)* and *‌[Pinguicula vulgaris](../../flowers/pinguiculavulgaris/)*.
