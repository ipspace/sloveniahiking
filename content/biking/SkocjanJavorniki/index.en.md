description: 'If you love biking on gravel roads through beech forests (autumn colors
  could be beautiful), the Javorniki ridge might be just what you''''re looking for.


  For everyone else: the ascent is pretty steep, and there are no views. Try [Slivnica](/en/biking/slivnicabiking).

## Notes

* There are numerous parking opportunities in [Rakov Škocjan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rak_%C5%A0kocjan). We usually park across the road from the hotel (see: starting coordinates).
* The area is crisscrossed with gravel- and logging roads, and we found no usable road signs. I used OpenCycleMap on ViewRanger to navigate (and even then, I got lost once). 
* You could take the same path we did or explore on your own. Most roads will take you somewhere (although it might not be the place you're looking for).
