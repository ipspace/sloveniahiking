### Notes

* Park next to the church in Zaplana, or at [Gostilna Mesec](http://www.gostilna-mesec.si/EN/) (after having a coffee, enjoying their strudel, and asking for their permission).
* The tour is somewhat harder in clockwise direction due to steep ascent toward Petkovec. 
* For a longer version of this tour, start in Vrhnika.
