### Notes

* You could start at [Gostilna Mesec](http://www.gostilna-mesec.si/EN/), at the church in Zaplana, or in Rovte (decent parking lot next to the main road Logatec-≈Ωiri).
* You could also start in Vrhnika -- combine this one with the tour from [Vrhnika to Zaplana](../vrhnikazaplana/).
* If you decide to start in Rovte, do the tour in clockwise direction.
* On a clear sunny day, you'll enjoy spectacular views. The photos on this page show you what happens if you insist on getting there when it's cloudy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
