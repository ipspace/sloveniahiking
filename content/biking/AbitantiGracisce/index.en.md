  It's way beyond that. The village was deserted when I hiked there years ago. This
  time, I found a group of renovated houses (and locals fixing even more of them)
  after a colorful ride across Istrian pine forests and meadows.

[Abitanti](https://visitkoper.si/en/about-koper/the-hinterland-of-koper/abitanti/) is a tiny Istrian hamlet that's not just in the middle of nowhere. It's way beyond that. Wikipedia [claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abitanti) it had 12 permanent residents in 2002; other sources claim the last granny living there died in 2002. Whatever the truth might be, life is returning to Abitanti. After a colorful ride across Istrian pine forests and meadows, I found a group of renovated houses and locals fixing even more of them.

## Getting There and Back

If you want to hike to Abitanti, start in Gradin ([machine translation of Slovenian description](https://sloveniahiking-rocks.translate.goog/hikes/abitanti/?_x_tr_sl=sl&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US)). Gradin is also an excellent starting point for a family biking trip (it's ~6 km from Gradin to Abitanti and back). I decided to start in Gračišče and tried to stay on asphalt roads. If you prefer dirt tracks, explore the [Path of Truffles and Asparagus](https://visitkoper.si/en/experiences/po-poti-tartufov-in-spargljev-k7/), which is also nicely marked on OpenCycleMap.

* Park in Gračišče. I usually use the parking lot behind the school (starting point); there's another one close to the gas station.
* Return to the main road, and follow the signs for Sočerga. At the end of the village, turn right toward Brezovica pri Gradinu.
* After ~5.5 km, follow the signs for Gradin/Abitanti onto a narrower road.
* In the next village, turn left (toward Gradin).
* In Gradin, follow the signs for Abitanti (the road from Gradin to Abitanti is partially a gravel road).

You could take a dirt trail (K7) into the valley beneath Abitanti to get back to Gračišče; I decided to return to Gradin and visit Sočerga:

* Return to Gradin.
* In Gradin, turn right (no sign) toward Brezovica pri Gradinu.
* In Brezovica pri Gradinu, follow the signs for Gračišče and later turn right toward Sočerga.
* Follow the signs for Sočerga until you reach the main road toward Buzet. Turn left (back to Gračišče).
* I hate biking on main roads, but I couldn't find a better alternative. Fortunately, a side road is veering right approximately a kilometer after Lukini. Take it -- it will bring you to the road from Gračišče to Movraž. Turn left, and you'll be in Gračišče in no time.
