## Getting There

* In Slap ob Idrijci, park in a small parking lot above the main road.
* Follow the signs for Šentviška Gora and stay on the main road until you reach a crossroads at the plateau's edge. Take a break. You could also park at the crossroads if you hate steep ascents.
* Turn right (direction Šentviška Gora) and follow the road till you reach the destination.

To reach the vista point:

* Turn right near the church in Šentviška Gora (direction Zakraj)
* A large meadow opens just after the last houses in the village. Cross it, and follow the left (ascending) asphalt road.
* A short but strenuous ascent will bring you to the vista point. Enjoy the views

I decided to return to Slap ob Idrijci; the locals had many enticing suggestions, including a roundtrip around the plateau. For more details, explore OpenCycleMap and the local information tables.
