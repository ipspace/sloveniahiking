## Getting There

I'm assuming you're not interested in the boring asphalt road from Idrsko to Livek, so we'll start in Livek. Even better, spend a few days at [Nebesa chalets](https://www.nebesa.si/en/) (and rent an e-bike there).

* From the parking lot at the edge of the village, follow the signs toward Matajur/Ajsa. Alternatively, you could drive to Ajsa (another parking lot, 200 m higher)
* In Ajsa, follow the signs for the parking lot/Matajur, then continue on the asphalt road that quickly turns into a gravel one.
* The gravel road becomes rockier as you progress and eventually brings you to the first meadows around Mrzli Vrh.
* When you reach the signs for Mrzli Vrh, leave the bike and hike to the top[^LTB].

If you feel like exploring the surroundings, continue on the gravel road and follow the signs for Idrska Planina (alp) or Svinska Planina. Alternatively, take a road descending toward the Italian border (instead of going up toward Idrska Planina), and eventually you'll get pretty close to the Matajur mountaintop.

[^LTB]: I didn't do that because I didn't have a bike lock with me -- not that I would need it, but it was a rented bike ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I used the same road to return to Livek; if you're of a firm downhill persuasion, try the marked dirt trail from Idrska Planina toward Livek (keeping in mind that you should drive slowly and be nice to the hikers).
