description: Getting to Pirnat Lodge at Javornik from Col is easy – you can drive
  there – but it's way more fun to take a detour via Križna Gora and another one through
  Vodice on the way back.

## Notes

* In Col, follow the signs for Predmeja and park at a large parking lot near the church.
* Continue toward Predmeja and take a right turn toward Žagolič.
* Keep going straight for several kilometers until you hit a T-junction of gravel roads. Turn right.
* You might notice a small crucifix at the top of the ascent. Take a break; you deserved it.
* Be careful when crossing the Col-Godovič main road – some drivers think they're on a racetrack.
* Follow the signs for Javornik until you reach the Pirnat Lodge.
* We skipped visiting the lodge. While it's nice to have a specific goal, the view isn't great, and the last bit of the road is disgustingly steep.
* Continue on the gravel road you used to ascend until you get to a 4-way junction. Turn right toward Vodice.
* Going straight or following an asphalt road going down will bring you almost to the spot where you left the car.
