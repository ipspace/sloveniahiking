  and the lovely meadows north of the Karst Edge.

**Notes**

* Park next to the road toward Hrastovlje -- there's a small parking lot on the right-hand side.
* For a much shorter version (skipping most of asphalt roads and the steep parts), start in Podpeč. Park at the small parking lot right after the village *and nowhere else*.
* You might want to turn around at the radio tower on the Karst Edge, or you could explore the nearby dirt tracks like we did (eventually arriving to Praproče).
* There are numerous dirt tracks descending from Karst Edge toward Podpeč and Rižana valley. We explored only one of them at the very end of the journey. Do better.

**Worth Visiting**

* Don't skip the [Podpeč Castle](https://www.istria-culture.com/en/the-podpec-castle-i39) or the medieval church in Hrastovlje.
* If you decided to explore the dirt tracks, visit the tiny church of Marija Snežna (St Mary of the Snows) -- marked *Gradišče (467 m)* on the map.
