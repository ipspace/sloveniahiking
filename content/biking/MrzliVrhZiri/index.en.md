Mrzli Vrh (Cold Peak) is a beautiful vista point high above Žiri, well
worth the effort you'll spend [hiking](../../hikes/mrzlivrh_ziri) or biking there – you'll enjoy the views of Škofja Loka hills, Idrija hills, and the Julian Alps.

## Getting There

* We'll start in Ledinica, a hamlet at the edge of Žiri. There's a tiny parking lot next to the river, or you could park in one of the larger lots in the industrial part of Žiri.
* Follow the road passing between the houses of Ledinica, then follow the signs for Mrzli Vrh. Whenever in doubt, stay on the main road.
* When you reach the saddle on the Mrzli Vrh ridge, turn sharp left onto a dirt road leading toward an amateur radio hut (you can't miss the gigantic antennae they use). Pass it, and stop a bit later at a lovely bench -- a perfect spot to have a break and enjoy the views.

Use the same road to get back, or take a left turn at Kmetija Brce (Brce farm) onto a very steep gravel road that will take you straight to Ledinica.

## Want more?

* If you have a mountain bike, try following the hiking trail toward Breznica.
* There's also an asphalt road to Breznica via Ledine and Ledinske Krnice, and a gravel road through Korita.

## Korita and Breznica

It's well worth taking the longer descent through Korea and Breznica; the views along the trail marvelous.

* From the saddle, go south keeping to the leftmost asphalt road until you reach a roadside chapel. Take a break and enjoy the view.
* After another ~200m turn sharp left onto a narrow asphalt road that eventually becomes a dirt road.
* After a hairpin turn around a house, stay on the right (wider) trail to get to Korita.
* Descend through the hamlet and turn left after the last house onto the road toward Breznica.
* Just before Breznica turn right onto a road descending toward Žiri.
* In Žiri, turn left (just before the bridge) onto a wide footpath running along the Sora river and follow it until you get back to your car.
