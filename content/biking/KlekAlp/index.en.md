## Getting There

* I parked next to the main road at Mrzli Studenec. It's even easier if you're staying at Pokljuka -- start from wherever you are.
* Follow the signs for Lipanca onto a gravel road going into the forest.
* Follow further signs for Blejska Koƒça/Lipanca and Pod Klekom, and avoid closed-off logging roads.
* After ~4 km, turn slightly right following a sign for Pod Klekom (the road to Lipanca goes left) or white/blue biking waymarks.
* Don't worry when you hit a barrier. The gravel road toward Klek Alp is closed for traffic, but cyclists can use it between June 15th and October 31st.
* Stay on the main gravel road.
* After another ~4 km, you'll notice a waymarked hiking trail crossing the road. It might be faster to leave the bike there and hike to the alp.
* Still on a bike? Keep to the right on all subsequent junctions until you reach the grassy trail leading to the alp.
* Hike to the alp, take a break, and enjoy the view!
