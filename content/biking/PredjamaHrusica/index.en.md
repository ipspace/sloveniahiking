## From Predjama to Hrušica

* Park at [Predjama castle](https://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/predjama-castle/). Be there early; the parking lot tends to get very busy in the summer.
* Return to Bukovje and follow signs for Hrušica/Podkraj (this bit is missing from the GPX file).
* After a few kilometers, leave the asphalt road and follow hiking signs for Hrušica and waymarks onto a gravel road.
* Follow the waymarks and an occasional road sign for Hrušica until you reach [Stara Pošta inn]({{<ref "/hikes/Hrusica/index.en.md">}}).
* Hike the *Archeological Trail* if you want to explore the Roman ruins.
* Have lunch at Stara Pošta inn.

## Back to Predjama

* On the way back, take the first gravel road going left.
* Follow the gravel road (keeping to the right) until you get to a Y-junction. Take the left fork (the right one is a dead-end).
* Turn right when you reach a large junction of gravel roads in the middle of a clearing.
* In Gorenje (a hamlet next to Bukovje), turn right onto a narrow asphalt road.
* Follow the first gravel road descending toward Bukovje.
* Keep to the gravel road; when in doubt, take the left fork.
* In a few minutes, you'll reach the Bukovje–Podkraj asphalt road. Turn left, and you'll get back to Predjama in no time (it's all downhill from there).
* Don't forget to visit the Predjama castle ;)
