Gornje Poljane (1065 m) is the highest-lying hamlet in southern Slovenia. You can [hike there on a waymarked trail from Viševek](https://www.loskadolina.info/en/gornje-poljane-1065-m.html) or bike on a gravel road starting near Babna Polica.

## Notes

* Start in Pudob or park at the Snežnik Castle (I started from the [Cherry House](https://www.loskadolina.info/en/apartment-sneznik.html) in Kozarišče), then follow the main road toward Babno Polje (boring) or detour through Vrh and Babna Polica.
* To get to Vrh, you could follow the main road toward Babno Polje, then turn right toward Vrh (also dull) or use the [Loška Dolina Heritage Route](https://www.loskadolina.info/en/the-loska-dolina-heritage-rout.html).
* You'll find the yellow signs for Loška Dolina Heritage Route (Pot dediščine Loške doline) in Kozarišče. If you're starting from Pudob, turn right toward Kozarišče, then go straight onto a gravel road when the asphalt road makes a right turn, and then take the next left.
* The gravel road is short (but steep) and quickly leads to the asphalt road toward Vrh, just above the tiny church of Holy Family.
* Continue the ascent on the asphalt road until you reach Babna Polica. Turn left before the village.
* Cross the Lož-Babno Polje main road to reach the gravel road toward Gornje Poljane (you could also park there, but what's the point?).
* After a hefty dose of huffing and puffing, you'll reach the beautiful meadows below Gornje Poljane and the hamlet.
* Don't forget to take the steep footpath into the forest to reach the Saint Andrew church above the hamlet.

### Getting Back

* I used the same route to return to Kozarišče.
* You could skip the detour through Babna Polica and use the main road to return to Pudob.
* If you have a mountain bike (and know how to use it), try taking the waymarked path toward Viševek.
