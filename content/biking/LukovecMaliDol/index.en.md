## Notes

* I started at [Hotel St. Daniel](https://www.stdaniel.si/en/)[^1]. You could start in [Kobjeglava](../path9ponds) or park at the hunting lodge in Tupelƒçe (the starting coordinates).
* Somewhere in a large meadow just past Lukovec, find a narrow trail going left (you might notice the blue biking marks; I was going too fast for that). If you keep going straight, you'll hit a nasty roadblock[^2] and will have to turn around[^3]. I removed the erroneous segment from the GPX file.
* Once you reach the asphalt road toward Komen, ignore the dirt roads going left until you reach a WW2 monument.
* A few kilometers after Mali Dol, the dirt road turns left, and there's a small sign for *Spacalova pot* on the right, sending you straight onto a narrow footpath. Don't miss it - the dirt road ends at a pasture.

[^1]: Highly recommended if you're looking for a quiet and friendly place to stay.

[^2]: Experiencing first-hand what happens when someone buys a small plot of land in the middle of nowhere without realizing the implications of a gravel road crossing it. A few years ago, they allowed the bikers to pass; the current total roadblock is probably a consequence of obnoxious individuals pestering the annoyed landowner with legal arguments (I could read them between the lines of a lengthy _No Trespassing_ notice).

[^3]: One would hope that the local tourist organization posting excellent signs on all major junctions would add a sign saying _don't go that way, the road is closed_. Alas...
