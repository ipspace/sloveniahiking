description: Križna Gora is a peak on a ridge between Lake Cerknica and Lož Valley.
  From here, one can enjoy a nice view of the nearby Karst plateaus and the surrounding
  hills. The peak has been a [fortified settlement since ancient times](https://www.loskadolina.info/en/krizna-gora-hill-857-m.html),
  made even better with the addition of the Church of the Saint Cross in the 16th
  century.

## Notes

You can hike to Križna Gora from Sveta Ana (the hamlet below it, 20 minutes), from [Križna Cave](https://krizna-jama.si/en/) (20 minutes), or Lož (1 hour). You can also try to master the trail leading to the top with a bike (I almost made it).

-   Park in an extensive parking place at the edge of Lož. If you plan to hike to Križna Gora, drive to where the road to Sveta Ana forks from the road toward Podlož (there are ample parking opportunities there, but not near Sveta Ana)
-   Follow the signs for Sveta Ana / Križna Gora.
-   At the top of the asphalt ascent, take the gravel road toward Križna Gora.
-   The gravel road quickly turns into a rocky trail. If you're hiking, follow the path passing the Stations of the Cross; if you're biking, "enjoy" the huffing and puffing.
