## Notes

-   I usually park at [Divje Jezero](https://www.geopark-idrija.si/en/natural-heritage/karst-and-hydrologic-phenomena/) (Wild Lake). You could drive all the way to the Lajšt (confluence of Idrijca and Belca rivers, also a natural bathing area), but then you'd miss half the fun.
-   Bike along the river, then take the left road after Lajšt (signs for *klavže*).
-   The asphalt road turns into a well-maintained gravel road after the last houses, becomes a bit steeper, and brings you to Brusove- and later Putrihove [Klavže](https://www.geopark-idrija.si/en/cultural-heritage/mining-heritage/).

You could turn around at Putrihove Klavže and return to wherever you left the car, but it's more fan (and not too strenuous) to continue to the Idrijca Valley:

-   Stay on the same gravel road until you reach Krekovše (a small cluster of houses including a hunting lodge).
-   Follow the leftmost road, then take the right (descending) one at the next junction.
-   After crossing the Idrijca River, turn right and follow the river to return to Lajšt and Divje Jezero.
