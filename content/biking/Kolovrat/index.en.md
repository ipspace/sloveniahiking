## In a Nutshell

* I started at [Nebesa chalet](https://www.nebesa.si/en/) above Livek (highly recommended). You could start in Livek (for an extra 150m of altitude gain) or even in Kobarid.
* From Kobarid, start toward Tolmin, then turn right (direction Livek) in Idrsko. From Livek, follow the signs for Livške Ravne or Kolovrat. From Nebesa, start biking uphill ;)
* Keep on the main road, and you'll eventually reach the [outdoor museum](https://www.kobariski-muzej.si/en/guided-tours/outdoor-museum-kolovrat/). Don't forget to enjoy the views ;)

If you don't mind gravel roads, return via Italy:

* Keep going south (toward Tolmin), then follow signs for Italy (keep to the right). When arriving in Italy, take the right fork (heading uphill) and you'll eventually reach a gravel road that'll take you back to Slovenia.

I missed the "follow the gravel road" part of the instructions and took one of the dirt trails that separates the Slovenian and Italian asphalt roads. I also couldn't resist visiting Kuk, the highest peak in the Kolovrat range (an extra 120 m altitude gain):

* When returning toward Kobarid, take a right turn onto a concrete trail just after the sign announcing the Kobarid county.
* Follow the disgustingly steep concrete/gravel trail to the peak.
* Enjoy the views ;)
