## Vojsko from Čekovnik

* I love Čekovnik, a village on the sunny southern slopes above upper Idrijca valley, but it's hard to find a place to park somewhere along the road. We solved the problem by spending a few nights at [Na Kupčku Estate](https://www.nakupckuestate.com/) (highly recommended)
* As you probably arrived from Idrija, keep biking in the same direction, and admire the views of Idrijca valley and nearby farmhouses.
* Once you reach the Idrija-Vojsko road, turn left and enjoy a more gradual ascent toward the Saint Joseph church in Vojsko.

You could return the same way or make a short detour to Mrzla Rupa (a saddle between Vojsko and Trnovski Gozd):

* From the parish church, follow the signs for Gorenja Trebuša.
* Take the leftmost asphalt road at every fork until you get to Mrzla Rupa (end of asphalt). Don't rush; the views of Trnovski Gozd are spectacular.
* At Mrzla Rupa, take the leftmost gravel road to get back to the Idrija–Vojsko road. Turn right to start your descent toward Čekovnik.

## Alternative Ascents to Vojsko

**From Idrija**: Park in the large public parking lot near the city center and follow the signs for Vojsko.

**From Idrija via Čekovnik**: Start in Idrija and take a detour through Čekovnik on the way there or back (adds at least 200 m elevation gain).

**From Spodnja Idrija**: Park near Kolektor/Hidria in Spodnja Idrija, follow the direction toward Oblakov Vrh. In Srednja Kanomlja, turn left onto a narrower road toward Vojsko.
