description: I love hiking across the hills on the limestone edge of Slovenian Istria,
  but whenever I'm schlepping myself along the long dirt trails, I dream of doing
  them with a mountain bike. As it turns out, what looks like a wide and easy dirt
  road when you're hiking could turn into a mischievous beast when you are on a bike,
  including the trails between Kuk and Lačna.
difficulty: Steep ascent on asphalt followed by gravel roads and dirt trails

## Notes

* From the road toward Buzet, follow signs for Movraž and park at the edge of Gračišče.
* Follow the road toward Movraž (I took a detour through Smokvica because why not)
* In Movraž, follow signs for Rakitovec, or try to find your way through a maze of tiny streets.
* A steep (16%) ascent starts just after Movraž. Don't worry if you find it hard -- it consistently devastated me.
* When you reach the plateau around Rakitovec, turn left onto a dirt road and follow hiking waymarks (red circle with blue line)
* After a short and pretty easy ascent, the dirt road merges with a wider gravel road that will slowly bring you to Kuk.
* Ready for dirt trails? Follow the hiking waymarks and blue signs onto a dirt trail descending toward our next destination: Lačna.
* There's a dirt/gravel road descending toward Smokvica just before the start of the final ascent toward Lačna. If you found the last bit of the trip demanding, you really should take it.
* Still with us? After a few short, steeper sections, the narrow dirt trail brings us close to the vista tower on Lačna. Take a break, climb the tower, and enjoy the view.
* I found the descent to Gračišče the most challenging part of the tour. You might want to skip it, return to the gravel road I mentioned above, and use it to get back to Smokvica.
* So you decided to go for it? Cool. Follow the blue signs and arrows onto a narrow rocky and/or muddy dirt trail. Keep left, and you'll eventually hit the old road from Kubed to Gračišče. You're almost there: turn left, push through the last ascent (yeah, I know, totally superfluous), and you'll be in the village. Follow what seems to be the main road, and you'll safely get back to your car.
