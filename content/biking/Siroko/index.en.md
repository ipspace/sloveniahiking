description: '[Široko](https://siroko.si/en/home/) is a vista point on the northern
  edge of [Banjšice Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banj%C5%A1ice_Plateau),
  high above the confluence of Idrijca and Soča. Getting there takes a steep and strenuous

  ascent regardless of whether you hike there from Most na Soči train station or bike
  from the village center, but the rewarding views of the southern ridges of the Julian

  Alps are well worth the effort.

## Getting There

* Park in a large parking lot just outside of Most na Soči village.
* Return to the village center, cross the main road, and continue onto a narrow barely-visible descending road.
* Cross the Idrijca river and stay on the main road (following rare signs for Široko farm) until you reach a tiny rest area in Tolminski Lom.
* Take the left road, huff-and-puff for another half an hour, follow the signs for the Široko parking lot and enjoy the views.

{{<note info>}}According to OpenCycleMap, the hiking path from the train station might be wide enough for a mountain bike descent; unfortunately, an incoming thunderstorm made sure I couldn't check it out.{{</note>}}
