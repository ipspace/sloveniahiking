### Notes

* I started in Marezige. It might be better to start in Koper, unless you truly enjoy an uphill struggle at the end.
* You could park in Marezige or close to the Koper -- Vanganel main road (I've seen a parking sign at the junction toward Kampel).
* You really don't want to hit the Šmarje -- Koper main road, particularly not in high season. I took the side road toward Bošamarin and thus missed the village center... but I've been in Šmarje before.
* You should do some sightseeing in Šmarje (including visiting Santomas wine cellar), and either return to the road toward Bošamarin, or continue toward Gažon on the next ridge.
* To get to Bošamarin, take a sharp right turn just after you reach the main road Šmarje -- Padna. There's no sign toward Bošamarin.
* I used side roads to get to the Koper -- Vanganel road. OpenCycleMap came handy.
* Use the cycling lane to get to Vanganel. You don't want to experience close encounters with local racers.
* To get to Montinjan, take a left turn just before the roundabout in Vanganel. There's a sign, but not visible from your direction (assuming you used the cycling lane till its very end).
