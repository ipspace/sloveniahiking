description: This is not my lame attempt at reaching Zen... the farmers in Slovenian
  Karst used ponds with clay bottom to collect rainwater, and there's a nice path
  linking nine of those ponds as well as several small caves around Kobjeglava and
  Tupelče.
difficulty: Gravel roads with a few short steeper sections. Suitable for a family
  hike/biking tour.

## Notes

* The path was designed for hikers, but as it's following gravel- and dirt roads it's easy to do it with a mountain bike.
* Start in Kobjeglava, park at a large parking lot near the center of the village (note: I started in Tupelče, so the GPX file and video are a bit off).
* You'll find the first sign for "*Pot devetih kalov*" left of the well in the village center;
* Some of the signs along the path seem to be missing. Use a bit of intuition, the GPX file, and OpenCycleMap, and turn the lack of signs into a scouting exercise.

For a few more details, explore the *[Trail of Nine Ponds](https://www.visitkras.info/en/trail-of-nine-ponds)* page.
