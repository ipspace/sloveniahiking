description: We decided to continue our exploration of Karst dirt trails when visiting
  our friends in Tupelče. We started in Pliskovica, dropped by Volčji Grad and Gabrovica,
  barely managed to find a long-lost dirt trail from Gabrovica to Kobjeglava, and
  returned to Pliskovica via Kosovelje.
difficulty: A mix of dirt trails and footpaths with an occasional asphalt road. Take
  a mountain bike.

## From Pliskovica to Gabrovica

* Park in a tiny parking lot at the southern edge of Pliskovica
* Take the left road into the village. Go straight at the first junction, then keep left.
* After the last house, take a dirt road going right.
* Follow the widest dirt road until you get to a T-junction in the forest (if you get to a meadow with a monument, you got too far). Turn right.

* When you reach a gravel road, turn left. At the next junction, turn right (north).
* In Volčji Grad, keep to the right until you reach the gravel road going east (toward Gabrovica). 
* After a nasty steep section, you'll reach an asphalt road. Cross it and continue toward Gabrovica.
* In Gabrovica, stay on the main road until you reach the church.
* Keep to the right, cross the main road through Gabrovica, and continue onto a narrow asphalt road toward Kobjeglava.

## Gabrovica to Kobjeglava (or Pliskovica)

Now you have to choose between two sane and one utterly insane option. Sane options first:

* Turn right onto a gravel road and follow signs toward Kosovelje (you'll miss Kobjeglava and Tupelče).
* Use the asphalt road to get to Kobjeglava.

**The insane option**: OpenCycleMap claims a dirt trail runs parallel to the Komen–Kobjeglava main road. More precisely: long long time ago, there was a dirt trail...

* The start of the dirt trail is pretty obvious, but then it turns sharp right at a vineyard. Don't take the right turn; continue onto an overgrown path going straight.
* It only gets worse. We got lost a few times. I used GPS navigation to keep us relatively straight, and veering left seemed a pretty successful strategy.
* Eventually, we ran out of luck. The trail was so overgrown that it was impossible to continue. We started carrying bikes through the adjacent (probably deserted) grassland, where we found a barely visible footpath running parallel to our trail.
* At the end of that field, we crossed onto another well-maintained meadow -- a good sign, as the farmers need to get there -- and found a gravel road leading into it. The gravel road brought us to Kobjeglava.
* In Kobjeglava, turn right onto the main road through the village to get to Tupelče.

## From Tupelče to Pliskovica

* Take the narrow asphalt road going right from the pond in the center of the village (see also: [The Path of Nine Ponds](../path9ponds/)).
* Keep going straight, and you'll eventually reach Kosovelje.
* In Kosovelje, follow the signs with a little lamb ([Pliska Trail](https://www.visitkras.info/en/pliska-trail)) onto an asphalt road leading straight back to Pliskovica.

**Another insane option**: Keep following the little lamb. It will lead you onto a narrow rocky footpath that will also bring you to the church in Pliskovica. Remember that you're not the target audience for Pliska Trail -- be polite, don't scare the hikers, and don't take the trail on sunny weekends.
