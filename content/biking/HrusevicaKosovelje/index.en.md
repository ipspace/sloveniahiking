description: It's easy to meander around Slovenian Karst on a bike as it's crisscrossed
  with paved roads. Still, it's more interesting to stay on gravel roads and try to
  find old overgrown dirt tracks, this time taking us from Hru코evica to Kosovelje.
difficulty: From gravel roads to footpaths, with an occasional stretch of asphalt
  or two.

## In a Nutshell

* I started at [Hotel St Daniel](https://www.stdaniel.si/en/) in Hru코evica[^2]. You could begin in 맚anjel or park near the cemetery at the edge of Hru코evica.
* From the village center, follow the widest gravel road going south. The gravel road will bring you to an asphalt road close to Kopriva.

* Turn right, and after approximately 100 meters, turn right onto a narrow road leading into the village.
* As you bike through Kopriva, keep right until you find a gravel road that crosses the railway.
* Stay on the broadest track as the gravel road eventually turns into a dirt road and finally into a dirt track.

* Eventually, you'll come to a junction where the dirt track veers right, and a narrow single-track goes toward the left. Take the single-track that will bring you to a gravel road. Turn left.

* At the next crossing, follow signs for Kosovelje.
* In Kosovelje, keep to the right to get to Pliskina pot -- a well-maintained footpath that will bring you to the asphalt road from Pliskovica to Gabrovica.

* According to the map, there's a dirt track running parallel to the asphalt road. I found something, but it was so overgrown I gave up and took the asphalt road till Gabrovica.
* At the edge of Gabrovica, take a dirt track going right. It will bring you to a gravel road leading back toward 맚anjel/Hru코evica.

If you started in 맚anjel, follow biking signs for 맚anjel until you get there. If you began in Hru코evica, you could use the same strategy to get to Kobjeglava or Tupel캜e, or you could try to find a shortcut[^1]:

* After a gravel road crossing where the sign for 맚anjel sends you left, find a narrower dirt track going right.
* Follow that dirt track until it starts getting wider and turning north. 
* Find another dirt track forking right (hint: OpenCycleMap helps). This one will bring you straight to Hru코evica.

[^2]: Highly recommended. I loved it the first time I've been there, and I keep coming back. They are only getting better.
[^1]: Don't worry about getting lost -- as long as you don't turn around, you'll end in Kobjeglava, Tupel캜e, or Hru코evica no matter what.
