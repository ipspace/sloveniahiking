## From Borovnica to Pokojišče

* Park near the railway station in Borovnica. There's another (smaller) parking lot near the public library.
* Follow the signs for Pekel.
* Take the right road (Zalarjeva cesta) at a roadside chapel
* Follow the signs for Pokojišče
* Huff and puff for four kilometers
* Take a breather at St. Stephan's church and enjoy the views

## Getting Back

If you're on a racing bike with paper-thin tires, you won't make it past Padež (the next hamlet) where the asphalt road turns to gravel.

Everyone else can enjoy a lovely descent through dense woods; just make sure you have the digital maps with you *before going into the woods* (mobile Internet might be spotty). Unfortunately, my watch stopped recording the location, so the descent is not included in the GPX track. 

* In Padež, follow the signs for Cerknica
* Take the left fork at the first gravel junction
* Keep to the left *while staying on the gravel road* (do not follow the hiking signs for Borovniški Pekel onto a dirt trail)
* Ford the stream (have fun at high water), then take a left turn, immediately followed by a right turn.
* You (almost) made it. Use the gravel road to get to Brezovica, then stay on the main road until you get to Borovnica.
