## Notes

-   I started at the hotel; you can park in Hruševica or Kobjeglava (in this case, bike to Hruševica first).
-   Follow the road going south from the village center. The asphalt road quickly turns into gravel, bringing you to Kopriva.
-   Turn right into the village, find your way through it, and turn right when you return to the main road.
-   When you reach Skopo, turn right, traverse the village, and find the narrow asphalt road toward Krajna Vas.
-   Go straight through the village, cross the main road, and continue onto a narrow road that brings you to the main road toward Pliskovica.
-   Bike to the church at the hilltop above Pliskovica, pass it on the right until you get to the cemetery, then turn left and immediately right onto a rugged gravel trail (the most challenging part of the trip).
-   Cross the main road toward Komen and continue toward Kosovelje.
-   Go straight through Kosovelje onto a gravel road toward Kobjeglava.
-   If you parked in Kobjeglava, keep going straight until you arrive at the parking lot. If you started in Hruševica, follow the signs for Tupelče/Štanjel.
-   After arriving in Tupelče, turn right at the village pond, and bike toward Hruševica.
