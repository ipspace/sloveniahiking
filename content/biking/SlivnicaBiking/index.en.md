description: If you'd like to enjoy the view of Lake Cerknica and don't feel like
  hiking to Slivnica, use the gravel road to bike there. Be careful on summer weekends
  -- some people think that "*spending a day in nature*" means "*drive to the mountain*
  *hut and have a beer,*" and many of them haven't yet mastered the art of driving
  on a gravel road.
difficulty: Occasionally steep gravel road

## Notes

* Park at the [usual place]({{<ref "/hikes/Slivnica/index.md">}})
* Leaving the parking lot, turn left and keep going mostly straight or slightly right.
* Following the signs for *Dom na Slivnici* (Slivnica mountain hut), stay on the broadest gravel road until you get to the top.

## Back to Cerknica

* You could take the same road, but that's boring.
* Several singletracks and dirt trails are going down Slivnica's western slopes. Check Opencyclemap for details.
* We took an alternate road circling Slivnica -- keep on the rightmost gravel road going down, following signs for *Grahovo* and later *Velika Krpanova Pot* (also: *VKP*).
