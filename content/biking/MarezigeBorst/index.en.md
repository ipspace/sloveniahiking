description: The tour from Marezige to Boršt will take you onto scenic hills around
  Rokava valley. The descent from Labor to Dragonja valley (should you choose to do
  it) is just the icing on the cake.
difficulty: Lovely tour on asphalt roads in Slovenian Istria. Optional challenging
  descent on a rocky dirt road.

### Notes

* Parking opportunities in Marezige or Lopar.
* Locals are recommending the [Karjola restaurant in Marezige](https://karjola.si/en/home/).
* Recommended stay: Holiday House Ida in Marezige
* If you want to stay on asphalt road, take the road toward Koper in Boršt, and visit Glem. You could also go to Labor and back.
* Ready for a challenge: the dirt road starts next to the church in Labor and brings you to Dragonja valley. From there, enjoy an easy gravel road to Župančiči, where the boring asphalt starts.
