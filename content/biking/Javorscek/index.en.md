  in Bovec, I wondered how to get to the giant rockslide on the northern slopes of
  Javoršček clearly visible across the Soča valley. It turns out it's easy – a gravel
  road will get you there, and it's clearly marked, as the rockslide created an excellent
  vista point with views of Rombon and Kanin.
difficulty: Gravel road with a few steeper sections

## Getting There

* You could start in Bovec, or park at Bovec airport or {{<start>}}Čezsoča{{</start>}}. I'll wait for you at the Soča bridge next to the Čezsoča parking lot.
* Ready? Follow the signs for Slatenik onto a gravel road running along the Soča river.
* Turn left when you hit an asphalt road, and follow signs for Javoršček onto another gravel road.
* Whenever in doubt[^DB], stay on the broadest gravel road until you reach the vista point.
* Enjoy the views ;)

[^DB]: You will have plenty of opportunity for that -- I found exactly two signs.
