  below-freezing temperatures in July -- making it a perfect summer destination when
  you're tired of heat waves and summer crowds.

## Notes

* [Park in Predmeja and bike to Čaven mountain hut](../cavenbiking/)
* Following the signs for Krnica and Trnovo, take the left (descending) gravel road.
* Continue on the gravel main road, which eventually turns into an asphalt one, until it brings you to a homestead in Krnica.
* Turn right onto a gravel road, which eventually morphs back to asphalt, indicating a very steep section ahead.
* The asphalt road brings you to a saddle above Smrečje with an excellent view of enormous spruce forests.
* After descending into the hollow, take the left fork at the junction next to the Smrečje information table.
* Follow the road through Smrekova Lazna (a large clearing in the forest) to the asphalt road leading to Mala Lazna.
* Descend to [Mala Lazna](../malalazna/), take a break, enjoy the views, and then use the asphalt road to return to Predmeja.
