I'm too old for hard-core mountain- or cross-country biking, but I still prefer gravel roads and dirt trails with an occasional (careful) single-track descent over asphalt. If that sounds familiar, you might find my collection of bike tours useful.

**Notes**

* The biking tours are the green dots on the above map. Hiking trips with English descriptions are red, hikes without descriptions are gray.
* I started publishing my tracks in early 2021. Don't expect miracles.
* I'm publishing GPX files instead of turn-by-turn descriptions. 
* You'll find *notes* attached to every tour, identifying interesting places worth visiting, navigational hints, or alternate paths.
* I usually drive to *somewhere* and bike from there. The *starting point* is usually where I managed to park my car. You might also find *parking opportunities* in tour description.
