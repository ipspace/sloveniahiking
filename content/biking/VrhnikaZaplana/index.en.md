### Where to Start

* There are tons of parking opportunities along the path – in Vrhnika, at the [start of the footpath to Planina](../../hikes/spica/kv/) (where I started), near [Kuren](../../hikes/spica/kr), at the church in Zaplana, or at [Star Maln](../../hikes/spica/sm/).
* The tour is a bit easier when done in the counter-clockwise direction.

### Navigation Tips

* To get to Stara Vrhnika, turn left just before the football field, and then immediately turn right.
* In the center of Stara Vrhnika (next to the chapel) go straight, and then immediately turn left.
* Follow the signs for Star Maln throughout Strmca. 

### Places to Visit

* [Mountain hut at Planina](../../hikes/spica) (marked Špica on the map) – *[Vrhniški štruklji](https://www.visitvrhnika.si/en/vrhnika/worthy-of-attention/rolled-prune-dumplings)* are delicious. I skipped it because I try to avoid the usual weekend crowds. To get there, turn left onto a gravel road at the end of the ascent from Stara Vrhnika toward Zaplana instead of following the asphalt road toward Zaplana.
