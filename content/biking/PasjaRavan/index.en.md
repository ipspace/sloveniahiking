description: Pasja Ravan used to be the highest peak in Polhov Gradec hills until
  the Yugoslav army decided to level it to build a radar station. Yugoslavia is long
  gone, and so is the radar station. Still, the gravel road to the top remains --
  an ideal opportunity to bike there and enjoy fantastic views from the ridge separating
  Gorenjska from Notranjska.
difficulty: A mix of asphalt and gravel roads with the usual "_Does it have to be
  so steep?_" parts

## Notes

* I parked at the "official" parking lot for hikers going to [Tošč](../../hikes/tosc/) or [Grmada](../../hikes/polhograjskagrmada/) just after Polhov Gradec. There might be some parking opportunities further down the road, but don't press your luck.
* Bike north, following signs for Petačev Graben and later Črni Vrh. If you want to avoid gravel roads, stay on the main road Polhov Gradec -- Črni Vrh.
* In Črni Vrh, follow the signs for Škofja Loka.
* When you get to a saddle with phenomenal views (including Mount Triglav), take the left road (signs for Poljane).
* At the top of the ascent, turn right onto a washed-out gravel road -- you might see a sign for *vremenski radar* (weather radar). The first few dozen meters were way too harsh for me, but it levels out afterward.
* There is no view at the top, but it's nice to take a break sitting at the edge of a large clearing[^1].
* Return to the asphalt road and continue biking uphill. Follow signs for Poljane until you get to a hairpin junction where you have to turn sharp left (direction Lučine).
* At the next house, turn left onto a descending dirt road. The dirt road quickly turns into a gravel road, passes two farms, and ends at an asphalt road. If you don't like dirt trails, continue along the ridge until you find an asphalt road going left.
* Go (mostly) straight until you reach Polhov Gradec.

[^1]: If you believe in the evil powers of 5G, stay well clear of the radar dome. Also, I have it on good authority that if Bill Gates managed to surreptitiously add a chip into your COVID-19 vaccine, that chip might permanently glue you to the dome.
