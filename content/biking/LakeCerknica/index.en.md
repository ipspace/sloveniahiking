description: Biking around Lake Cerknica was always a pleasant experience, and it
  got even better since the local tourist organization marked four trails, from a
  family-friendly one to a slightly more demanding trip to Rakov Å kocjan.

**Four Steps to a Perfect Trip**

* Lake Cerknica is an intermittent lake. You might want to [check the water level](https://g0.ipcamlive.com/player/player.php?alias=5efae4a5d932c) before taking the trip; you'll love the views when the lake is at its maximum.
* Park at a large parking lot close to Dolenje Jezero.
* Walk to the nearby [Museum of Lake Cerknica](https://jezerski-hram.si/en/) and select one of the four suggested tours.
* Follow the signs and enjoy ;)
