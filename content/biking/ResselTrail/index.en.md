description: The edge of Gora (plateau high above Vipava Valley) is full of fantastic
  vista points. A few of them are reachable with a road bike; we'll visit the westernmost
  one and explore an ancient dirt trail laid out by Josef Ressel on the way back of
  the ship propeller fame.
difficulty: Somewhat steep asphalt road. Optional dirt trail descent.

## Notes

* There's a large parking lot next to the church in Lokavec
* From the parking lot, turn right toward Predmeja
* Follow the main road until you reach Predmeja
* Turn right (direction Col/Otlica)
* In a few minutes, you'll arrive at a tiny clearing. Enjoy the view!

## Returning to Vipava Valley

* If you had enough, turn around and enjoy the long descent toward Lokavec.
* If you're on a road bike, you might want to traverse Gora and return to Ajdovščina/Lokavec via Col.
* If you happen to be of the downhill persuasion, use the [old road built in the 1830s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predmeja#History) (laid out by [Josef Ressel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Ressel) when he was working there as a forester) to get back to Lokavec.

## The Ressel Trail

* From the vista point, follow the blue signs onto a challenging narrow rocky dirt track (you might want to skip that part and join the Ressel road further downhill).
* The dirt track merges with the asphalt road you used to ascend. 
* Follow the road until the first hairpin, where the blue signs send you onto a comfortable gravel road.
* Keep going straight until you reach Gorenje.
* Find your way through the narrow streets of Gorenje, veering toward the right. Once you reach the main road, turn right, and you'll get back to the Lokavec-Predmeja road in no time.
