  I hike there, but the gravel road it was bastardized into comes handy if you decide
  to get to the top with a mountain bike.

### In a Nutshell

* Start in [Podgorje](../../hikes/podgorje)
* Follow the signs for [Slavnik](../../hikes/slavnik) until the village center where the red hiking signs send you into two different directions.

Choose between:

* **Marked gravel road**: follow the signs pointing right (Slavnik, 1h30m), and red arrows or hiking waymarks whenever in doubt (suggestion: avoid the hiking shortcuts ðŸ˜Ž).
* **Rockier but not so steep firefighting road**: Turn sharp left onto a narrow asphalt road. It quickly turns into a gravel road. Follow uphill-pointing blue (biking) signs.
