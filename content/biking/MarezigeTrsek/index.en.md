### Notes

* There's a large parking lot in the center of Marezige
* To get from Trsek to Popetre, take a sharp left turn at the beginning of the village (there's no sign).
* Near the bus stop in Popetre, go straight toward Gradišče (longer) or left toward Lopar (what I did)
* If you decide to return to Marezige via Gradišče, drop by Kubed to see a [rare pentagonal church tower](https://sloveniahiking.rocks/en/hikes/lacna/kubed/).
* Locals are recommending the [Karjola restaurant in Marezige](https://karjola.si/en/home/).
* Recommended stay: Holiday House Ida in Marezige
