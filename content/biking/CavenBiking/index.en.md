If you've explored all the footpaths to the [Čaven mountain hut](../../hikes/caven), it's time to bike there. We'll start in Predmeja; if you're looking for a much longer ride, [choose Lokavec as your starting point](../resseltrail).

## Getting There

* Park next to the head of the hiking trails in Predmeja. There are also parking opportunities further up the road.
* Follow the asphalt road toward Lokve for 2.5 kilometers, then turn left onto a narrower gravel road (signs for Čaven)
* The ascent gradually becomes steeper, and when the gravel turns into an asphalt road, the going gets tough... fortunately not for long.
* Stop at the top of the ascent and enjoy the fantastic view of the Vipava valley -- it's much better than the view you'll have from the mountain hut, which is just a few hundred meters further down the road.
