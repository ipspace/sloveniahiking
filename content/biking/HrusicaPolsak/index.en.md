description: We'll start in Kalce, bike through the forests on the slopes of Hrušica,
  drop by a renovated homestead in the middle of nowhere, and visit the ruins of a
  Roman fortress. Take this tour when you need to clear your head, de-stress, or mull
  over new ideas. You won't be disturbed by traffic, hikers, or spectacular views.
difficulty: Gravel roads. Expect a bit of huffing and puffing.
