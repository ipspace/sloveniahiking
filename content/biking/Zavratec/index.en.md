## Notes

* We started in Sopovt, using the tiny parking spot at the start of the trail toward [Vrh Svetih Treh Kraljev](/en/hikes/vs3k/sopot/). You could start in Rovte or Žiri (see [Alternatives](#alternatives)).
* You'll reach the watershed at the top of the ascent through Zavratec -- Primorska will be on your right (south), Gorenjska on your left (north).
* The view from Šinkovčev grič in Medvedje Brdo is phenomenal and well worth the extra effort to get there.
* Somewhere around that point, you'll be in the tri-region area -- the boundary between Gorenjska and Notranjska is the watershed between Sora and Ljubljanica. You'll be biking around that watershed until Rovte.
* Stop at [Tavžentroža](../zaplanatavzentroza/) for a cup of decent coffee. Don't expect too much if you like biking in the morning -- they couldn't deliver something as simple as apple strudel on a Saturday morning "because the kitchen starts working at 12 PM."
* If you prefer to stay on asphalt roads, take the Logatec-Žiri main road to get back to the car instead of biking through Rovte (the last section along Sovra river is still a gravel road).

## Alternatives

* You could start in Žiri and bike through Ledinsko Razpotje, Gore, and Dole.
* Instead of returning to Sopovt, continue toward [Vrh Svetih Treh Kraljev](../../hiking/vs3k/) (another steep ascent) and reach Sopovt via Hleviše.
