description: Volovja Reber is a long ridge on the southwestern edge of the Snežnik
  plateau. It's one of those magical places where you rarely encounter a fellow hiker
  or biker, even though it's only a few kilometers away from an overcrowded main road.
  Let's enjoy the beauties of karst meadows and pastures while biking to Velika Milanja
  -- the highest peak in the ridge with an unusual rocky top.
difficulty: Occasionally steep gravel roads

## Notes

* Park at the rest area at the edge of Šembije
* Going from the rest area toward Šembije, take the first gravel road on the left. Keep slight right.
* After traversing a large pasture, start following the white-blue biking signs.
* Near the top, the biking signs send you left onto a dirt track. We decided to take a detour continuing on the gravel road and reached the peak from the eastern side.
