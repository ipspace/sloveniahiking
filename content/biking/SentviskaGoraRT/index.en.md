## Notes

-   Drive toward Šentviška Gora and park at a small parking lot next to the junction for Pečine.
-   Bike toward Pečine and follow the main road through the village until you reach the top of the ascent.
-   Turn right onto a narrower ascending road (direction *Gor. Vrh*)
-   Stay on the main road until you reach a junction where it's almost impossible to decide which fork to follow. Turn left onto a concrete road.
-   Follow the concrete road (eventually turning to gravel) until you reach a junction leading into a hairpin. Take the hairpin (direction *Jerovca*), then follow the signs for *Št. Gora* until you get to another asphalt road.
-   Turn right. When reaching the main road through Šentviška Gora, turn left toward the village center. Take a break and enjoy the view.
-   Optional: visit the [vista point in Zakraj](../sentviskagora).
-   Use the main road to return to your car.
