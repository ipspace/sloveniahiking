Two roads lead from Sanabor (a hamlet on the western slopes of Nanos plateau) to [Abram]({{<ref "/hikes/nanos/abram/index.en.md">}}) (one of the few still-active homesteads): a pleasantly cool gravel road along the Bela stream and a sunny asphalt road going straight from Sanabor to Abram.
  
{{<hike-details>}}

In summer, I take the gravel road on the way up and the asphalt road on the way down. This time I decided to enjoy whatever sun had to offer on a chill autumn morning:

* I parked at [Vipavska Bela]({{<ref "/climbing/vipavskabela/index.en.md">}}) climbing crag to avoid the boring part of the trip. You could park at the large parking lot in Vipava (adding almost 5 km and ~190 m elevation gain).
* Follow the road from Vipava to Col (via Vrhpolje) until you get to a left hairpin with a side road to Sanabor/Abram going right.
* Just before Sanabor, decide how hot you want to be: turn right (Sanabor/Abram -- my choice) to follow the sunny asphalt road or left (Bela) to follow the stream into the forests.
* Follow the asphalt road till you reach Abram.

## The Nanos Glaciers

**To set things straight**: Nanos is way too low to have glaciers. What they call glaciers are ice caves where the locals mined ice in the spring/summer and transported it to Trieste from where it was exported all the way to Africa.

**Fair warning**: While the gravel roads are well-maintained, you'll be entering pretty wild hard-to-orient terrain with plenty of forks, no mobile coverage, and useless signs. Download digital maps (OpenCycleMap works just fine) to your smartphone.

* From Abram, follow the signs for *Pot ob Ledenikih* (Glacier Way) onto a decent gravel road.
* At the next T-junction, turn left (there's an ancient barely-readable right-pointing wooden arrow saying "Podnanos").
* At the next major junction, a sign saying "Blažon" pointed straight on; I turned right (down).
* (Optional) Stop at the *Veliki Vipavski Ledenik* (*Big Vipava Glacier*) sign and explore the cave.
* Eventually, you'll reach a large parking lot occasionally used by logging trucks. Follow the signs for Vipava, and in a few kilometers, you'll get back to the Sanabor–Abram road.
