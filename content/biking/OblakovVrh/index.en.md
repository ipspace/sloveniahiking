Oblakov Vrh (Cloudy Peak) is a saddle[^S] between Kanomlja and Hotenja valleys with a beautiful view of the Idrija Fault (both valleys resulted from that fault). We'll bike to Oblakov Vrh from Dolenja Trebuša and enjoy a panoramic view of the Julian Alps on the way back.

[^S]: I never understood why Slovenians insist on calling saddles peaks, but there you go.

## Getting There

* Park near the primary school in Dolenja Trebuša[^SP]
* Cross the stream (Hotenja), then turn left and follow signs for Oblakov Vrh. It will take you a bit more than an hour to get there.
* On the way back, take a narrower, steeply ascending asphalt road on the first left hairpin.
* When you get to a fork, stop and enjoy the view. If you don't have a mountain bike, turn around and use the main road to return to Dolenja Trebuša (the descent ahead of us is somewhat brutal).
* Still with me? Take the left road.
* The asphalt road will eventually turn into a well-maintained gravel road, cross another meadow, and start descending.
* Take a sharp left onto a narrower half-forgotten washed-out gravel road (I found a wooden sign for Trebuša).
* When you reach the valley, turn right and keep going straight until you return to Dolenja Trebuša.

[^SP]: I started a bit further up the Hotenja valley as I decided to stay in Dolenja Trebuša for a few days.
