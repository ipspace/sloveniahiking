### Climbing Is Not as Safe as Watching Videos

Rock climbing is not something you do after attending YouTube university. If you're not an experienced rock climber, get professional help; there are dozens of [licensed mountain guides](https://zgvs.si/en/mountain-guide/) in Slovenia. 

I can highly recommend [Gregor Šeliga](https://www.facebook.com/gregor.seliga), [Tina di Batista](http://zgvs.si/vodnik/?id=244) or [Miha Habjan](https://www.facebook.com/miha.habjan.3), and the receptionist at [Camp Tura](https://www.kamp-tura.si/) might have a few more suggestions.

### A Few Notes

* Vipava crags are spread across a large area. Each sector is pretty small, and the hiking time ranges from 10 to 45 minutes.
* You can climb in Vipava from early autumn to late spring. It's way too hot in the summer.
* The sun reaches most of the sectors around 10 AM. Don't even try to start earlier than that in winter.
* Some sectors (Leva Plošča, Pikapolonica) are family-friendly; others are decidedly not.
* Grades of easier climbs are usually demotivational. Don't bother; choose something way below your top performance and enjoy.

### Recommended Sectors

* Mala Plošča has a few interesting boulder-like climbs.
* The right side of Oltar has amazingly compact rock (warning: you'll need 70 m rope).
* Luska has fantastic almost-multi-pitch climbs.
* Pikapolonica is the traditional beginner's crag, full of lovely easy climbs, although the rock could be a bit crumbly. The right half is family-friendly and well-protected.
* Triptih is a sector-of-last-resort when Pikapolonica becomes overcrowded.
