description: Climbing the rockfaces above Vršič pass is as close as one can get to
  Plaisir alpine climbing in Slovenia. You'll start above the treeline, hike for 30-45
  minutes, and enjoy an extensive collection of trad- or bolted multi-pitch climbs,
  either in full sun ([southwest face of Nad Šitom Glava](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/showCrag.asp?crag=720)) or shadow (north faces of
  [Nad Šitom Glava](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/showCrag.asp?crag=771) or [Mala Mojstrovka](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/showCrag.asp?crag=770)).

## Recommended Climbs

I loved climbing these routes:

* Stoletje (VI-/IV, 180 m)
* Juševa smer (V/IV, 180 m)
* Zajeda skozi okno (V+/IV, 180 m)
* Severovzhodni greben (Northeast Ridge) of Nad Šitom Glava (IV-V/II-III, 200 m)
* Smer po zajedi (V+/IV-V, 300 m)
* Severni raz (North Ridge) of Mala Mojstrovka (IV/III-IV, 300 m)

Severni Raz in Mala Mojstrovka's north face is the easiest of them all and suitable for total beginners (trust me, we tried it out); the others require at least some climbing skills to be enjoyable.

## Notes

* The routes in the southeast face of Nad Šitom Glava are a bit shorter (180 m versus 300 m), steeper, and more demanding.
* The southeast face of Nad Šitom Glava is in shadow after 2 PM, making it possible to climb there in summer; you'd be better off going there in spring/autumn and enjoying the sunshine.
* When I was younger, I climbed at least some of the above routes as the lead climber. Today, I prefer climbing them with a mountain guide -- I can highly recommend [Tina di Batista](http://zgvs.si/vodnik/?id=244) or [Gregor Kofler](https://www.kofler-sport.si/en/mountain-guiding-slovenia/rock-climbing-slovenia-alps/).
