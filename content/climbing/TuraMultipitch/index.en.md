  rock and almost a dozen bolted multi-pitch routes.'

## A Bit of a Warning

What I'm describing here is not part of the [Vipava sports climbing area](../vipava). You must be proficient multi-pitch climber; if you're not, get professional help. There are dozens of [licensed mountain guides](https://zgvs.si/en/mountain-guide/) in Slovenia. I can highly recommend [Miha Habjan](https://www.facebook.com/miha.habjan.3) -- exploring this crag with him was a great experience.

Finally, a helmet is a must -- we had a bird throwing stones at us.

## Notes

* Park at a large parking lot near Gradišče campsite.
* Follow the footpath (not Via Ferrata) toward Gradiška Tura.
* After passing the sports climbing crag (Oltar), follow the hairpins until you'll reach a large slab with clearly visible bolts ascending toward the sky.
* I haven't found a climbing guide for the area yet. The [leftmost route](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/showRoute.asp?route=7409) (starting on a rock pillar almost hidden in the bushes) is a IV-; most of the others are somewhere between V and V+.
* The bolted routes are ~90 m long and many pitches exceed 40 m; you'll need at least a 50 m rope.
* While it's possible to rappel from the top, we decided to climb out and descend on a marked footpath.
* You'll pass another fantastic sports climbing crag (Luska) on the way back. It might be worth stopping there as well.
