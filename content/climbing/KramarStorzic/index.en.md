description: If you like easy long climbs and aren't bothered by occasional loose
  gravel, you'll love Kramarjeva Grapa (Kramar's Gully) in Stor탑i훾's north face. Apart
  from a few meters of a bit more demanding climbing, the difficulties usually don't
  exceed being on a steep, somewhat irregular ladder. Kramar's Gully is also excellent
  preparation for climbing the Slovenian route on Triglav's North Face.

## Notes

* It's not uncommon to see a seasoned climber soloing this route. If you're reading this, you're probably not one of them -- hire a mountain guide. I loved the days I spent there with [Tina di Batista](http://zgvs.si/vodnik/?id=244) (who also took all the photos).
* Unless you're a fast climber, prepare for a day-long trip.
* You could also climb this route in winter, but be wary of avalanches; they love to take it on their way down. I did a winter climb years ago and found it much more strenuous than a summer one.
