It's always great to climb with someone familiar with every detail of the rockface, and it would be hard to get someone better suited for the job than [Urban Ažman](https://www.facebook.com/urban.azman), a local mountain guide who started climbing in Debela Peč as a teenager. 

Climbing in Debela Peč usually starts with a long ascent from Krma valley[^1]; we decided to take an alternate approach across Pokljuka and reached the rockface via an almost abandoned hunting trail -- an exciting experience by itself. We planned to climb one of the easiest routes (South-West Ridge, IV/III, 200 m) but quickly diverged from the plan and found a beautiful new line across a previously unclimbed pillar, adding proverbial icing to an already delicious cake. 

The final touches of a beautiful day: 

* Hiking to nearby [Brda](../../hikes/brdalipanca), another rarely visited peak, to experience another fantastic view of the rockface we climbed.
* Delicious lunch at [Pr Jagru Inn in Zatrnik](https://goo.gl/maps/zqFkiLzBT8v98UaF8) (a mandatory pit stop on the way from Pokljuka).

[^1]: A much longer approach with elevation gain over 1200 m.
