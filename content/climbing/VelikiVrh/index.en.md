description: Veliki Vrh is a barely noticeable peak in a side ridge west of the prominent
  peaks of the Kamnik Alps. What sets it apart is a patch of monolithic rock in its
  southwest face with [over a dozen well-protected bolted multi-pitch routes](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/showCrag.asp?crag=668) -- the
  ideal destination for a leisurely day on the rocks or the first steps into the exciting
  world of multi-pitch climbing.

### Don't Wing It

Even though the routes are well-protected, don't even think about climbing them on your own unless you had proper training, including multi-pitch rope maneuvers. Hire a [mountain guide](http://zgvs.si/en/mountain-guide/), offload all the worries, and focus on climbing.

Need a recommendation? Our family loved the day we spent there with [Tina di Batista](http://zgvs.si/vodnik/?id=244), and I thoroughly enjoyed the climbs with [Miha Habjan](https://www.facebook.com/miha.habjan.3).

## Recommended Climbs

* *Sanje neke gospodinje* (Housewife's Dreams) is an ideal starting point -- easy climbing after you master the crux in the first pitch. Don't worry if you're a beginner; in the worst case, the lead climber will pull you through the tricky bit.

* *Črni metulj* (Black Butterfly) is an interesting combination of slightly more intricate details.

* *Valček* (Waltz) tries to find some remaining space on the lower parts of the face, gives up before the last pitch, and turns right into a pretty technical corner.

* *Mama Korzika* (Mother Corsica) starts with an attractive overhanging corner and ends with a nasty technical slab.

More details in the recommended guidebook or on [plezanje.net](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/showCrag.asp?crag=668).

## Notes

* You could climb in Veliki Vrh from mid-spring to autumn. The rockface is in shadow until ~ 11 AM -- start late in spring/autumn and early in the morning in summer.
* You'll love the grades -- I don't think I've ever climbed an easier VI- or VII-.
