  [Vipavska Bela](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/showCrag.asp?crag=640) is my favorite climbing spot. Compact rock, short and sweet climbs, lovely family-friendly surroundings, no-hassle parking, a two-minute walk to reach the crag... what else should one hope for?

### The Mandatory Warning

Rock climbing is not something you do after watching YouTube videos. If you're not an experienced rock climber, get professional help; there are dozens of [licensed mountain guides](https://zgvs.si/en/mountain-guide/) in Slovenia. 

I can highly recommend Gregor Šeliga or [Tina di Batista](http://zgvs.si/vodnik/?id=244), and the receptionist at [Camp Tura](https://www.kamp-tura.si/) might have a few more suggestions.

### A Few Notes

* The crag is in a pine forest facing east. 
* Spring and autumn mornings are fantastic. It's too cold in the winter, and supposedly the summer evenings could be pleasant. When dropping by in June, I try to be there around 8 AM and leave before 11 AM.
* Some of the climbs are still sparingly bolted. Think before climbing.
* You might find the grades demotivational. Use them as rough guidance, and start with something that's way below your top performance.
* The climbs are short, and the crux is usually just a few moves. It's almost like bouldering on a rope. Some people love it; others hate it.
* The easy climbs get crowded over the weekends, but if you're comfortable climbing 6b, you'll still have a wonderful experience.
* Did I mention the crowds? Footholds on popular climbs tend to be well-polished.
