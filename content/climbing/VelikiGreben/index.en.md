description:
  Veliki Greben is a giant ridge in the heart of the Kamnik Alps. Even though it ends at a popular hiking trail traversing the southern slopes of Skuta (near the [Instagram-famous bivouac](https://www.pd-ljmatica.si/koce/bivak-pod-skuto/)), you are almost guaranteed to climb it in perfect solitude. Combine that with fantastic views from the exposed thin edge you'll be climbing, and you'll get an unforgettable experience.

## Notes

* There's a reason not many people climb this ridge; it takes over two hours of pretty steep hiking to get there.
* The climbing is not hard. Depending on where you start, you might have to climb an attractive, slightly overhanging corner (or engage in serious bush-walking); the rest of the climbing is pure poetry.
* Don't even think about going there on your own unless you're an experienced alpine/trad climber. Take a mountain guide and enjoy!
* The only (printed) information I could find is in the *Kamni≈°ka Bistrica* climbing guide (currently out of print).

## Recommendations

I enjoyed climbing Veliki Greben with [Tina di Batista](http://zgvs.si/vodnik/?id=244). She also took all the great photos on this page.
