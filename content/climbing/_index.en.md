title: Climbing in Slovenia
---
Climbing in Slovenia is a year-long activity. There are [over 120 sports climbing crags](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/cragIntro.asp?type=C&ord=n&cc=SI), some of them warm enough for winter climbing, tons of [trad](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/cragIntro.asp?cc=SI&type=W)- and [bolted](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/cragIntro.asp?cc=SI&type=L) multi-pitch climbs, icefalls...

Before going any further, please be considerate of the Mountain Rescue Service: unless you know what you're doing, go climbing with a [mountain guide](https://zgvs.si/gorski-vodnik/).

### Recommended Climbing Guidebooks

* If you're a seasoned sports climber, get the [Slovenia Climbing Guidebook](https://sidarta.si/izdelek/slovenija-sportnoplezalni-vodnik-2020/) and start exploring
* There's a similar guide for a selection of [multi-pitch climbs](https://www.kibuba.com/literatura/knjige/plezanje-c1888/plezalni-vodnik-moderne-vecraztezajne-smeri-slo-alp)

While one would hope for a similar guidebook covering trad climbs, the situation remains pretty hopeless -- there are a dozen guidebooks covering various areas, most of them only in Slovenian and out-of-print.
