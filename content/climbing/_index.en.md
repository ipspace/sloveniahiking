title: Climbing in Slovenia
---
Climbing in Slovenia is a year-long activity. There are [over 120 sports climbing crags](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/cragIntro.asp?type=C&ord=n&cc=SI), some of them warm enough for winter climbing, tons of [trad](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/cragIntro.asp?cc=SI&type=W)- and [bolted](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/db/cragIntro.asp?cc=SI&type=L) multi-pitch climbs, icefalls...

If you'd like to do a bit more than just hiking in the mountains, or if you'd like to try out rock climbing, you might like some of the ideas I put together based on my personal experience. Also, assuming you're a climbing beginner, you might want to play it safe and hire a [mountain guide](https://zgvs.si/gorski-vodnik/); I included some recommendations in individual climb descriptions.

If you're a seasoned climber, you're probably [looking for more information](../about/climbing-guidebooks/).
