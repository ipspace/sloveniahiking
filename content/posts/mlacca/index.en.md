intro: |
  The winter of 2021 is weird. After years of warm green winters, we got tons of snow in the mountains. The temperatures are all over the place, from warm fronts peaking at 15°C to bursts of arctic cold air resulting in ridiculous frosts (how about -25°C?)

  Now imagine you just bought a new set of winter gear, and you're desperate to use it, but the continuous avalanche warnings keep you from going high into the mountains.

  Climbing a vertical frozen column of water is a must-have experience. Not sure about that? Get an ice climbing instructor or a mountain guide, and try it out in Mlačca gorge.

Imagine you just bought a new set of winter gear, and you're desperate to use it, but the weather is not playing along. It might be too cold, or there might be too much fresh snow, or there's high avalanche danger...

You could hike around hills and pretend 10cm of snow and a bit of ice on the footpath warrants the use of crampons. If you haven't been there yet, explore [Polhograjska Grmada](../../hikes/polhograjskagrmada), [Tosc](../../hikes/tosc), [Blegoš](../../hikes/blegos) or [Mali Golak](../../hikes/maligolak).

You could also hope your incredible good luck will hold back an avalanche and hike above the tree line (hint: don't)... or you could try ice climbing. Climbing a vertical frozen column of water is a must-have experience.

Not sure whether that's what you'd like to do? Why don't you try it out? Pavel Skumavc has been turning the [Mlačca gorge](https://lednoplezanje.com/en/ice-climbing/) into an ice-climbing area for decades and manages to build fantastic ice sculptures almost every year. Contact him to check the ice conditions, pick up your crampons and ice axes, and spend a wonderful day trying out something you never dared to dream about.

### Don't Even Think about Winging It

If you're an experienced ice climber, you're probably not reading this article anyway (or you already left this page and picked up your phone to call Pavel). Everyone else, read carefully. I shall write this only once[^2]

Ice climbing is not without risk. Don't ever try to figure out an activity that could kill you by watching YouTube videos (and lie to the team at Mlačca gorge that you know what you're doing). Hire an instructor -- the best option would be one of the many [Slovenian Mountain guides](http://zgvs.si/en/mountain-guide/).  Need a recommendation? Climbing in Mlačca with [Miha Habjan](https://www.facebook.com/miha.habjan.3) was a great experience.
