The winter of 2021 is weird. After years of warm green winters, we got tons of snow in the mountains. The temperatures are all over the place, from warm fronts peaking at 15°C to bursts of arctic cold air resulting in ridiculous frosts (how about -25°C?)

Now imagine you just bought a new set of winter gear, and you're desperate to use it (ignoring for the moment the pandemic restrictions).

You could hike around hills ([Polhograjska Grmada](../../hikes/polhograjskagrmada), [Tosc](../../hikes/tosc) or [Blegoš](../../hikes/blegos) come to mind) and pretend 10cm of snow and a bit of ice on the footpath warrants the use of crampons. 

If you _REALLY_ know what you're doing (or think you do), you could hike a bit higher and hope your incredible good luck will hold back an avalanche... or you could try ice climbing. Climbing a vertical frozen column of water is a must-have experience.

But here's another snag: the varying temperatures aren't exactly great if you're trying to freeze a waterfall. Also, some of those waterfalls that managed to get frozen tend to be under steep slopes. Avalanche anyone?

Don't despair; there's a solution. Pavel Skumavc has been turning the [Mlačca gorge](https://lednoplezanje.com/en/ice-climbing/) into an ice-climbing area for decades and manages to build fantastic ice sculptures almost every year. Contact him to check the ice conditions, pick up your crampons and ice axes, and spend a wonderful day trying out something you never dared to dream about.

### Don't do it on your own

If you're an experienced ice climber, you're probably not reading this article anyway (or you already left this page and picked up your phone to call Pavel). Everyone else, read carefully. I shall write this only once[^2]

Ice climbing is not without risk. Don't ever try to figure out an activity that could kill you by watching YouTube videos (and lie to the team at Mlačca gorge that you know what you're doing). Hire an instructor -- the best option would be one of the many [Slovenian Mountain guides](http://zgvs.si/en/mountain-guide/).  Need a recommendation? [Miha Habjan](https://www.facebook.com/miha.habjan.3) was an excellent guide when he took me there.
