## Online Resources

* [plezanje.net](https://www.plezanje.net/climbing/index.asp) is the ultimate online resource. It's a Slovenian-only site, but that shouldn't be a problem in the world of Google Translate.
* [Primorske stene](http://www.primorskestene.com/) is a lovingly-curated web site of trad routes around Soƒça valley.
* [Slovenske stene](https://www.slovenskestene.si/) is another quickly growing online portal focused on trad climbing.

## Guidebooks

* All (public) sports climbing crags in Slovenia are described in [Slovenia Climbing Guidebook](https://sidarta.si/izdelek/slovenija-sportnoplezalni-vodnik-2020/).
* There's a [similar guidebook](https://www.kibuba.com/literatura/knjige/plezanje-c1888/plezalni-vodnik-moderne-vecraztezajne-smeri-slo-alp) describing a selection of multi-pitch climbs.

While one would hope for a comprehensive guidebook covering trad climbs, the situation remains pretty hopeless -- there are a dozen guidebooks covering various areas, most of them only in Slovenian and out-of-print.
