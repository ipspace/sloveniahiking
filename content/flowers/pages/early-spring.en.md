If you hike around Slovenia in early spring, you'll quickly notice hellebores, snowdrops, snowflakes, and primroses. A bit later the meadows will be full of blue-eyed Marys, violas and crocuses.

Some spring beauties grow only in one or two places: checkered lily only on some marshes (including Ljubljana marshes, but you have to know where to look), broad-leaved anemone only on two limestone outcrops in Slovenian Istria, and the greater pasque flower in a few well-protected meadows on Boƒç.
