## Getting There

-   The hiking path starts at [Hi≈°a Ojstrica](https://logarska-ojstrica.si/), and I simply walked out the door as I was staying there[^NBC]. You should be able to park somewhere nearby.
-   Follow the road past the Plesnik homestead until you spot a red hiking sign sending you onto an ascending dirt trail that eventually turns into a footpath. Ignore the ridiculous timing advice -- it takes an average hiker approximately 90 minutes to reach the alp.
-   You'll reach the gravel road leading to the alp a few times. The hiking path is relatively well-marked, so you shouldn't find it too hard to follow the waymarks. When in doubt, take the ascending fork.
-   When you reach the wooden fences, you're almost there -- it's just a few minutes of an easy walk to get to the meadows.

[^NBC]: Not a bad choice if I say so myself
