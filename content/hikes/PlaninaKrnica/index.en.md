description: Planina Krnica (Krnica Alp) is a rocky alp high on the southern slopes
  of Kanin massif with a wonderful view of the peaks across the Soƒça valley. If you're
  stubborn enough you can get there by road; if you love long hikes start in Bovec.
  We decided for an interim approach.

## Notes

* Drive by Kaninska Vas toward Postaja B (Station B) of Kanin cable car.
* After a few kilometers you'll notice a cluster of yellow signs marking Kanin mule trail, one of them pointing toward "Planina Krnica / Postaja B". There are plenty of parking opportunities next to those signs.
* Follow the signs for "Planina Krnica" or "Postaja B" onto a gravel road that eventually merges with the marked path from Bovec.
* Follow the waymarks along an ever-narrower trail that almost disappears when it ascends along an imposing rock face.
* After the steep ascent you'll reach a fork where you'll have to decide whether to go to "Postaja B" (not really) or "Planina Krnica" (YES!).
* After the fork we had no major difficulties following the trail, and it took us ~45 minutes to reach the alp.
