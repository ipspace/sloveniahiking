## In a Nutshell

-   We started at our accommodation and took the [Plajer Trail](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-route/slovenia/plajer-trail/33600440/) to Bovec. You'll probably start in Bovec -- most trails begin at the town center.
-   We followed the signs for Čezsoča, then turned left toward Jablanca. After a long slog along an asphalt road, we tried out a footpath going right, which brought us back to the road almost exactly at the bridge across Soča.
-   We crossed Soča and continued toward Brjeka -- a magical spot with a massive rock in the middle of the river and a perfect place for a short break.
-   It was time to return: we followed the signs for Kal/Koritnica, crossed the village parallel to the main road, turned right to get to the last houses in the village, and then continued left onto a gravel road.
-   After a few kilometers, the gravel road brought us to a hanging bridge high above Koritnica.
-   We spotted a sign for Saint Lenart church along [Zgodovinska Pot (History Trail)](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-route/zgodovinska-pot-historic-trail-/33658792/), followed it, and eventually arrived at a tiny church in the middle of the forest -- an ideal place for another break.
-   The History Trail brings you to the main road, where it's easy to find trails leading back to Bovec. Have fun; we had to take a different path to return to House Natura. You could also take the uphill asphalt road and return to Bovec via Plajer Trail.
