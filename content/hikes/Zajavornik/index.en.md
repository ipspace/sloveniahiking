{{<hike-details>}}

Zajavornik[^ZJ] is a large sunny alp in the middle of the Pokljuka plateau with a beautiful view of the ridge between Pokljuka and Krma Valley. Hiking there from Hotel Pokljuka (former Sport Hotel) takes less than an hour on a (mostly) level gravel road, making it an ideal hike with small kids.

[^ZJ]: Also: Zajavorniki, Javorniki, Javorniška Planina, or Javornik, because everyone thinks they know better than locals what the place names should be. I have no idea what the correct name is.

-   Start from Hotel Pokljuka and follow the asphalt road back to the main road across the Pokljuka plateau. You might also be able to park at that junction.
-   Turn left, and after a few minutes, cross the road and follow signs for Lipanca / Blejska koča / Zajavorniki onto the gravel road into the forest.
-   Hike along the gravel road that eventually turns into a wide rocky trail. A short and not too-steep ascent brings you to the edge of the alp.
-   Enjoy the views and have fun ;)
