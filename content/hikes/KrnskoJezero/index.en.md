description: The wonderful Lake Krn on an alp north of Mount Krn is the largest Slovenian
  high mountain glacial lake. I found most of the hike from Lepena thoroughly boring,
  but the views from the alpine meadows and the lake itself are spectacular and well
  worth the effort.

## Notes

* Park near the mountain hut in Lepena
* The well-marked trail starts near the end of the road behind the mountain hut.
* You'll follow a wide mule trail that zigzags across a steep slope covered with beech forest for almost two hours (~700 m altitude gain).
* Once you reach the saddle in the ridge surrounding Lepena valley the fairy tale starts. Enjoy the magnificent views of the surrounding peaks!
* Keep to the right and stay on an easy path that will guide you across sunny meadows right to the lake.
