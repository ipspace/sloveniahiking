description: Kojnik is a wooded hilltop south of Slavnik with an excellent view of
  Slavnik and Goliƒç ridges. You might want to go there when you see hordes going to
  the vastly more popular Slavnik; it might also be a lovely destination for a longer
  family hike.
difficulty: A pleasant mix of gravel roads and somewhat steep footpaths

### Getting There

-   Park at the large parking lot in [Podgorje](../podgorje).
-   Returning to the main road, follow the sign for [Slavnik](../slavnik), then the one for Kojnik, which sends you right onto a gravel road.
-   After 1.5 km, the hiking signs point left onto a narrow gravel road. Follow that one until it ends in a Y-junction. Continue on the well-used right trail.
-   At least a dozen old trails and footpaths crisscross the slopes of Kojnik. Carefully follow the waymarks and stay on the well-worn path.
-   When you reach a clearing, stop for a bit and turn around -- the views of the Bay of Trieste are magnificent.
-   The hilltop might be windy, but finding a warm spot a bit further south is easy. Enjoy the well-deserved break.

Return to Podgorje using the path you used to get to Kojnik, or take a detour toward Zazid and return to Podgorje on one of the gravel roads.
