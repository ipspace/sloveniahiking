## Getting There

-   Hike to [Plesnikova Planina](../plesnikovaplanina).

Next: You can reach Icmanikova Planina on an old neglected waymarked footpath, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but seasoned mountaineers with a self-flagellating streak. Also, I couldn't find the start of the path; recent treefalls and new logging roads significantly changed the landscape. Fortunately, you can follow a not-too-boring dirt road:

-   From the huts on Plesnikova Planina, follow the signs for Strelovec.
-   Stay on the broadest road going uphill and to the left.
-   You'll reach the saddle at the beginning of Icmanikova Planina in 45 to 60 minutes of easy walking through sparse forests.

## Logarska Peč

You could follow the road and explore Icmanikova Planina; I decided to stop at the saddle and visit Logarska Peč -- a vista point with a phenomenal view of the main ridge of Kamnik-Savinja Alps.

-   The sign for the vista point (Razgledna točka) sends you onto a meadow. I couldn't find a path crossing it, so I ascended in the approximate direction the arrow pointed to (right of the small hut) until I reached the first trees.
-   A narrow footpath starts beyond the first trees somewhere on your left, runs parallel to the house for a bit, and then brings you to the vista point. Be careful; you'll be standing pretty close to sheer cliffs.  

## Getting Lost on the Way Back

If you insist on testing the waymarked footpath, here's how it worked out for me. Also, don't even consider taking it in wet/muddy conditions. It's a narrow footpath traversing steep, slippery slopes.

-   I couldn't find its start, so I descended an old dirt trail toward a small hut at the forest's edge.
-   There's a red hiking sign just after the hut.
-   The first part of the hike is not bad, although it's pretty easy to miss the narrow footpath.
-   You'll end on a dirt trail after traversing a gully (surprisingly comfortably).
-   The next section of the path is hard to find (I cheated and used a digital map with a GPS), but it's also not worth following. Stay on the dirt trail; on every fork, keep going down and toward the left (south), and you'll eventually end on the road from Logarska Dolina to Plesnikova Planina.
-   Find the waymarked path and use it to return to Logarska Dolina.
