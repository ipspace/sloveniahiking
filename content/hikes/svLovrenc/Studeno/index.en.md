### In a Nutshell

* In Studeno, follow the signs for *Sv. Lovrenc* onto a narrow road that brings you to a comfortable parking place.
* Find the sign for Sv. Lovrenc near a row of trees and follow it onto a footpath meandering through a sparse pine forest.
* The footpath quickly turns into a dirt trail going straight up the steep slope, first aside a massive clearing and later crossing sunny meadows.
* In a bit less than an hour, you'll reach the church of sv. Lovrenc (st. Laurent). Take a break and enjoy the view.

You might decide to end your hike at the church, or you could hike to the hilltop and make a detour on the way back:

* Find signs for *Sv. Lovrenc* pointing toward a footpath ascending through beech forest. In a few minutes, you'll reach the hilltop with lovely benches and an enticing south-facing view.
* Following the *Predjamski grad* (Predjama castle) signs, descend on a steep footpath following the waymarks until your path merges with a broader dirt trail coming from the right.
* Stop following the waymarks (which veer toward the right), and continue your hike on the dirt trail. 
* Cross a gravel road, take a left on all junctions, and you'll get to your car in less than 20 minutes.
