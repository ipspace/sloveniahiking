description: Planinica is the lowest-lying alp on the southern slopes of Begunjščica
  ridge. Hiking there will take a tad longer than an hour, and the hut on the alp
  promises all sorts of local delicacies and even ice cream -- a perfect family hike.

### In a Nutshell

* Drive to Gostišče Draga (Draga Inn) north of Begunje, and park somewhere nearby. There are two decently large public parking lots a few hundred meters up the road.
* Follow the road for approximately 1.7 km (slightly less than half an hour).
* You'll notice a rocky trail decorated with a faded waymark going left into the forest on one of the right bends. Follow that trail (it's so broad that it's impossible to miss).
* The trail crosses a gravel road a few times, and it's not always obvious where it continues. Use your scouting skills and look beyond the roadside bushes to spot an occasional waymark.
* When the trail brings you to a dirt road at the lowest edge of the alp, you'll find your path blocked by a barbed wire. What a welcome!
* Turn right, following a sign that's about to peel off from a tiny wooden board. Follow the gravel road (or a shortcut across the meadow) to the hut on the alp.
