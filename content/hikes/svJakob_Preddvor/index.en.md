{{<note warn>}}The path on the video shows us taking a steep shortcut on the way up and the old road on the way down.{{</note>}}

## It's as easy as 1-2-3

* Park on a gravel road right after the left turn next to Turn castle.
* Follow the gravel road till the fork, where you could choose between a leisurely walk on the gravel road or a decently-steep hike on a well-marked footpath.
* It's tough to get lost as long as you follow the signs for Sv. Jakob. The path is very well marked, and although there are tons of footpaths, biking trails, and logging roads in the forest below the hilltop, almost every shortcut and detour will bring you to the destination.

{{<note info>}}You'll find most of the unmarked footpaths on [OpenCycleMap](https://www.opencyclemap.org/?zoom=16&lat=46.31002&lon=14.44204&layers=B0000). For example, we took the old road (Stara Cesta) on the way down. It's not as steep as the marked footpath and not as dull as the gravel road.{{</note>}}
