description: Škavnica is a giant limestone slab in the middle of a pine forest on
  the west slopes of Nanos plateau. I usually hike there to admire its limestone pavement
  crisscrossed with deep fissures; the view of Vipava valley, Adriatic sea, and the
  Italian Alps is just the icing on the cake.
difficulty: Easy hike with a few steeper sections

## Getting There

* Hike to [Plaz](../plaz). Take a break and enjoy the view.
* Follow the waymarks onto a narrow footpath going west from the picnic tables north of the vista point.
* The footpath slowly turns into a rocky trail -- an old dirt road from Vipava valley toward Nanos. Keep to the right following signs for Škavnica.
* Another sign for Škavnica (or [Nanos/Abram](../nanos/abram)) will send you right onto a steeper shortcut.
* A bit after the point where your path merges with the original trail (which took a wide detour), you'll notice another sign for Škavnica sending you left onto a narrow muddy[^MUD] footpath.
* In ~15 minutes[^LTIME], the easy-to-follow well-marked footpath reaches a rocky barrier. A bit further on, you'll notice an easy ledge that will bring you to the top of the slab.

[^MUD]: At least it was muddy every single time I was there. Admittedly I'm hiking around those hills in autumn/winter and not during summer drought.

[^LTIME]: Vipava valley must have a large population of endurance runners -- most of the durations I've encountered were a bit overly optimistic. Expect to hike a bit longer than that.
