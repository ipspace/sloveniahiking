### In a Nutshell

* Park in a small parking lot at the edge of Podpeƒç Lake. Warning: totally overcrowded in summer and on sunny weekends.
* Follow the hiking waymarks and signs for Sv. Ana (Saint Ana) into the forest and onto a somewhat steeper footpath.
* Dozens of trails crisscross the slopes below the church. Try to follow the waymarks or hiking signs. You could also take any path going up; you're bound to get to the hilltop sooner or later.
* In less than 30 minutes, you'll reach the sunny meadows. Look around, find the church, walk to it, and enjoy the view.

Hopefully, you remembered all the forks you took (hint: breadcrumbs rarely work). If not, follow the signs for Jezero to get back to the car.
