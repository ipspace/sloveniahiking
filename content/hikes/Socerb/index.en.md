description: Socerb is a castle above the steep cliffs of Karst Edge with a beautiful
  view of the Bay of Trieste. You can get there by car (the castle restaurant has
  excellent food), but it's more fun to hike there from Osp, a village better known
  for its extensive climbing areas.

## From Osp to Socerb

-   Parking in Osp Valley became Mission Impossible after obnoxious climbers triggered a series of spats with the locals. The only place to leave your car is the car park underneath the Mišja Peč climbing area.
-   Follow the asphalt road into the village and ascend through narrow streets toward the church, where you should be able to spot the first waymarks.
-   The waymarks lead you onto a dirt trail. Follow signs for Socerb.
-   After crossing a (usually dry) gully, the waymarks send you right onto a steep trail that brings you close to Prebeneg, a village at the Slovenian-Italian border.
-   The path becomes even steeper as it tries to stay on the Slovenian side of the border and ends in a maze of tiny trails. I found no waymarks; a recent forest fire probably destroyed them. No worries -- eventually, you'll end up on a dirt trail going right that brings you to the asphalt road under Socerb.
-   Follow the waymarks through the village onto another trail leading to the castle. Enjoy the views!

## Getting Back

Want to take a different path to return to Osp? Let's visit Kastelec:  

-   Walk on the asphalt road until you find the first hiking signpost.
-   Follow the path toward Podpeč onto a dirt trail, footpath, and gravel road.
-   When you get to the sign for Kastelec/Osp, follow it onto a quickly descending dirt trail.
-   Cross the village and the asphalt road, and continue on a dirt road going south (toward open Karst meadows).
-   The next junction is the only place where I managed to get lost. The arrows are ambiguous; the correct choice was the less-used trail going slightly right.
-   The path becomes almost invisible around a pine tree strip. Keep going straight (small cairns will help you) until you reach the meadow's edge, where the path down into the Osp Valley becomes impossible to miss.
-   The rocky footpath eventually brings you to the dirt road you used a few hours earlier. Turn left to get back to Osp.
