Lipanca is a beautiful cozy meadow above the dark spruce forest of Pokljuka. Hiking there is an ideal family trip -- you can choose paths that take less than an hour in each direction, or longer ones that will take you half a day to get there and back.  You could also extend your hike with an ascent to a number of peaks in the ridge above Lipanca from where you'll have an awesome view of Triglav.
