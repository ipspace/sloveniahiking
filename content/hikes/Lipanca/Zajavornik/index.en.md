description: The hike from Zajavornik Alp is one of the longer hikes to Lipanca; start
  in Medvedova Konta if your final goal is one of the peaks above Krma Valley. On
  the other hand, you can often get to Zajavornik Alp in winter when most other roads
  on Pokljuka are closed, and you probably won't have any problems finding a parking
  spot.

### Getting There

-   Park at a large parking area north of Zajavornik Alp.
-   Follow the signs for Blejska Koƒça/Lipanca (and later waymarks) onto a wide, rocky northbound trail ascending through the forest.
-   Your trail eventually merges with the one coming from Rupe and turns right.
-   Turn left at the next junction (with the trail from Medvedova Konta), and you'll reach Lipanca in approximately 15 minutes.
