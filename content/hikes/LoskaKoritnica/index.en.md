## Notes

* At the northern edge of Log pod Mangartom village, follow the signs for *Koritnica*. Park immediately after the junction.
* Follow the road for a few hundred meters. At a large crucifix, turn slightly left onto a wide footpath going into the forest (signs: *Loška Koritnica - Gorenja*).
* The footpath is not marked but is pretty easy to follow. You'll find signs at all junctions. Getting across meadows around cottages might require some rudimentary pathfinding skills.
* After a few kilometers, the footpath ends at the gravel road. Turn left and start following the red hiking waymarks and signs for *Mangart* until you reach a hunting hut with a fantastic view of Mangart and Jalovec.
* Return on the same path, or use the gravel road to stay closer to the river.
* We got sick-and-tired of the gravel road and decided to get back to the footpath. We followed the signs for *Lukež*; a short ascent brought us to a house next to the trail we used earlier.
