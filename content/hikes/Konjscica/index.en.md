### Getting There and Back

* Park near Sports Center Pokljuka in Rudno polje
* Follow the signs for Konščica onto an asphalt road that quickly turns onto gravel.
* Keep slightly to the right (there are signs at every junction) until you reach the end of the road.
* Continue onto a dirt trail.
* After a while, turn left (follow the waymarks) onto a narrower footpath that brings you to the alp.

You can use the same path to return to Rudno Polje, take a somewhat more strenuous detour via a path traversing the Viševnik slopes (follow the signs for Rudno Polje onto a path that starts just below the huts), or visit Jezerce Alp and turn your easy walk into a half-day warm-up for longer hikes (3.5 hours, 11 km, 490 m altitude gain).
