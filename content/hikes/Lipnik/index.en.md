## In a Nutshell

* Park at the playground a bit above Zazid
* Return to Zazid and follow the signs and waymarks toward Lipnik along an asphalt (later gravel) road ascending toward Kraški Rob (edge of Karst plateau).
* After the railroad tracks turn right onto a dirt track leading into the forest.

* Keep right at the next fork (direction Lipnik) and left on most subsequent forks (waymarks are pretty explicit).

* The last ascent is a bit steeper and brings you to large meadows above Kraški Rob. Lipnik is just a short walk away (to the left).

You could return to Zazid via Zalipnik (the valley north of Lipnik):

* Use the waymarks to reach the dirt road in the valley.
* Turn left and walk along the dirt road until you hit a descending dirt track going left. Use that one and you'll arrive to the fork just above the railroad (see map).
