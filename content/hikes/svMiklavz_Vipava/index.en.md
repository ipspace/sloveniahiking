  before the gas station) -- the Saint Nicholas church, a perfect destination for
  a short family hike.

## Notes

* Park in a large parking lot above Gradišče (a village next to Vipava) near Kamp Tura.
* Here's a boring way to hike to the church: from the parking lot entrance, follow the signs for Miklav (local spelling of Miklavž, Slovenian name for Saint Nicholas) onto a well-marked dirt trail that eventually morphs into a footpath and brings you to the destination in ~45 minutes ([translated Slovenian text](https://sloveniahiking-rocks.translate.goog/hikes/svmiklavz_vipava/?_x_tr_sl=sl&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US) contains a more "poetic" description)

Want more fun (and avoid the crowds)?

* From the southern tip of the parking lot, follow a descending gravel road (toward the highway).
* Keeping onto the broadest road, take a left on every fork.
* The gravel road will eventually turn into a dirt road and later into a narrow dirt trail.
* A new vineyard (Wintura farm) will surprise you in the middle of an overgrown forest. A few minutes later, it's time to start looking for an uphill path that will take you to the waymarked trail.
* We took a steep footpath (following a beaten sign for Vipava Ultra Trail); it would be perfectly fine to take the next dirt trail going uphill -- the path we chose quickly merges with it anyway.
* Always choose the uphill trail, and you'll eventually reach the marked footpath. Turn right -- the destination is just a few minutes away. If you happen to get to a gravel road, you overshot -- turn left.
* On the way back, follow the waymarks, or take any one of the paths going down -- you're bound to reach the trail you used before.
