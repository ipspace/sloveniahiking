  the main road toward Buzet) to Lačna is an ideal short family hike that you could
  easily extend into a much longer experience, depending on how enthusiastic your
  kids are.

## Notes

* There is a decent parking lot at the edge of the village (next to the school and kindergarten)
* Walk toward the church of St. Nicholas until you hit the first red signs or waymarks.
* Turn left, and follow a narrow road veering slightly toward the right until you reach a wooden sign pointing onto a narrow footpath going into the forest.
* After a short ascent, you'll reach the first vista point. You might want to enjoy the view before proceeding toward the main ridge, where the footpath ends at a dirt trail.
* Turn right. After a few hundred meters, turn left to reach the peak with a small tower. You might want to climb the tower to enjoy the view of Slavnik and the surrounding hills.
* After a short break, you might decide to return to Gračišče, or you could go for a longer hike toward Kum (the views are well worth it).
