description: "Čaven is a Karst plateau (as well as one of the peaks in that plateau)\
  \ high above Vipava valley north-west of Ajdovščina. \n\nIts steep slopes presented\
  \ a formidable challenge to local farmers, who created a web of footpaths, dirt\
  \ trails, and narrow dirt roads to reach high-lying meadows and forests. You can\
  \ walk along those paths to get to *Koča na Čavnu* (Čaven mountain hut) from Predmeja,\
  \ Vrtovin, Stomaž, Kamnje, or Lokavec.\n"
