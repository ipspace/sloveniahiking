  If you like wildflowers, you MUST visit Zalipnik valley between Golič and Karst edge in early May, and while you're there, try to find [Slender Fritillary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritillaria_orientalis) on the northern slopes of Kavčič, the last peak before the Slovenia-Croatia border.

### Getting There

* You could reach Kavčič via marked footpaths from [Golič](../golic) or [Lipnik](../lipnik); I prefer [biking there](../../biking/podgorjekavcic).
* If you decided to follow my lead, leave the bike at the point where the marked footpath leaves the dirt road across Zalipnik valley (@ 8.6 km), and hike to the hilltop.
* Enjoy the views ;)
