Kavčič is the easternmost peak in the Kraški Rob (Karst Edge) ridge, with a beautiful view of surrounding meadows and hills. If you like wildflowers, try to be there in early May -- you'll love the flowering meadows of the Zalipnik valley, and if you're lucky you'll find [Slender Fritillary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritillaria_orientalis) on the northern slopes of Kavčič.

{{<hike-details>}}

### Getting There

* You could reach Kavčič via marked footpaths from [Golič](../golic) or [Lipnik](../lipnik)
* You can also [bike there](../../biking/podgorjekavcic), leave the bike at the point where the marked footpath leaves the dirt road across Zalipnik valley (@ 8.6 km), and hike to the hilltop.
* We'll go for a slow leisurely hike exploring gravel roads and dirt trails around Rakitovec

### In a Nutshell

* We'll start next to the Sports Park in Rakitovec. There's a small parking lot next to the main road (opposite the recycling bins), and a slightly bigger one next to the Sports Park.
* Start your hike on the gravel road that passes the Sports Park, and keep on the main road (veering toward the left) until it ends at a meadow.
* The dirt trail across the meadow is barely visible, but it's pretty obvious where it enters the forest at the other edge of the clearing.
* Stay on the dirt trail until you reach a gravel road. Turn left.
* Keep on the main gravel road until you arrive at a small wayside shrine. Turn left (the right fork brings you to Croatia).
* At the next junction, turn sharp right onto a well-maintained gravel road that eventually turns into a series of hairpins and brings you to a grassy terrace high above Rakitovec.
* You'll notice a narrower dirt road going left. Keep that in mind -- we'll need it to get back to Rakitovec -- and turn slightly right.
* Follow the rightmost ascending gravel road for a few kilometers until you reach an overhanging sunny rocky barrier -- a perfect place to take a break.
* After a minute or two, the gravel road brings you to expansive Karst meadows. Take a dirt road going uphill -- it will get you straight to Kavčič.

### Getting Back

If you love the terrain, take a roundtrip via Lipnik:

* Follow the trail parallel to the cliffs until you reach Lipnik (the next peak with a cross).
* Following a waymarked footpath, descend to a dirt trail running across a terrace.
* Turn left -- the dirt trail will bring you to the gravel road you used to get to Kavčič.

Had enough? Sure:

* Use the same gravel road to return toward Rakitovec, but turn right onto a narrower dirt road at the junction I mentioned earlier.
* The dirt road will bring you straight to Rakitovec village. Descend to the pond at the bottom of the village, then take an asphalt road going right.
* When you reach the main road, turn left, and you'll quickly return to your car.
