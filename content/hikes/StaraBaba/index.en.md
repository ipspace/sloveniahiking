  It must be a popular destination for afternoon strolls as it''s crisscrossed with

{{<note info>}}The paths described here are not marked, and there are so many footpaths on Stara Baba that it's easy to get lost. It might be a good idea to have a smartphone with OpenCycleMap data on it.{{</note>}}

### In a Nutshell

* Usually, you can park on the right-hand side of the road just before the Hubelj bridge. On weekends, you might have to drive a bit farther; there are a few parking spots just across the bridge.
* Take the gravel road leading east (back toward Ajdovščina). 
* Search for a footpath forking left into the forest. When you find the right one, it will lead you past interesting rocks to the top of the terrace.
* Enjoy the stroll along the edge of the terrace. Eventually, you'll have to turn left and walk toward a dirt track crossing a shallow valley between your path and the steep slopes of Gora.
* When you get to the dirt track, turn right and follow it until it meets a broader dirt track going uphill from Ajdovščina to Gora.
* Turn right, descend toward Ajdovščina until you get to the gravel road. Follow the gravel road back toward Hubelj.

If you don't like walking on a gravel road, take an alternate path (untested):

* Follow a footpath toward Grivče
* Turn right to get to the main road
* Cross Hubelj and walk back to the starting point following trails on the other riverbank.
