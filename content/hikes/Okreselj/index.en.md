## Before You Start

-   Most of the time, you'll be on a sunny rocky terrain with almost no shadow. Take a hat, sunscreen, and plenty of water.
-   The path is rockier than one would expect based on its altitude.
-   While you'll inevitably meet tourists wearing goofy shoes, that doesn't mean they made a good choice. You'll be more comfortable in decent hiking boots (and your ankles will be grateful).

## Getting There

-   Park at the end of the valley. Alternatively, leave the car at any public parking lot (a half-dozen of them are scattered around the valley) and use Logarska Dolina Trail to hike to the start of our hike.
-   Take the wide trail toward the Rinka waterfall.
-   After admiring the waterfall, cross the bridge and follow the red hiking sign for Okrešelj.
-   Stay on the hiking path until you reach the mountain hut.
-   After a well-deserved break, continue hiking for a few minutes toward Kamniško Sedlo to reach the beautiful meadows with fantastic views.
