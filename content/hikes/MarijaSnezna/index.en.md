### Getting There and Back

-   We started at the parking lot above Črni Kal crag and followed the waymarked path toward Praproče.
-   After a long walk along the scenic Karst Edge, the waymarked path turns left. Follow a dirt trail parallel to the cliffs until you encounter another waymarked footpath from Podpeč to Praproče.
-   Turn left (downhill) to reach Praproče, then follow the signs for Marija Snežna to reach the hilltop and the church.
-   After a short break, take a steep, unmarked footpath going west, then follow the easy-to-spot dirt trail to a gravel road from Črnotiče to Podpeč.
-   When you reach the gravel road, turn left. You'll return to the waymarked path you used earlier in a few minutes. Turn right to return to the Črni Kal castle and the parking lot.
