description: Nad Šitom Glava is an ignored peak above Vršič pass. Rock climbers love
  its eastern and northern rockfaces; most hikers ignore it while rushing to nearby
  Mala Mojstrovka. Guess what -- that gives you an option to avoid the crowds; all
  you have to do is to take a wrong turn ;)

{{<hike-details description="yes">}}

{{<note warn>}}**A bit of a warning**: the second part of the hike will take you onto an unmarked footpath that occasionally disappears when crossing scree fields. If you're a beginner, you might want to hike somewhere else (Slemenova Špica comes to mind).{{</note>}}

* Park at Vršič pass. There are plenty of parking opportunities, but it pays to be early[^1].
* Follow the signs for Mala Mojstrovka.
* Once you hike above the swathes of mountain pine, cross a scree field, and reach grasses just underneath a rockface, turn sharp right onto an unmarked footpath (~ 200 m elevation gain from Vršič pass).
* Follow the footpath (as best as you can) to the top.

[^1]: As you should be when hiking in the mountains.
