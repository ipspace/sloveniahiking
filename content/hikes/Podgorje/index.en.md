Podgorje is a small village under the southern slopes of Slavnik. Most hikers go to Podgorje for a short hike to Slavnik; if you want to avoid the crowds turn south toward the Karst edge and explore its beautiful views and endless meadows.

There's a large parking lot at the edge of Podgorje (south of the main road) -- don't try to wing it, park there (even though they charge for it over the weekend).
