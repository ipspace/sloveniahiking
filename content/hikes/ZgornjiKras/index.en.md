{{<hike-details description="yes">}}

Drive toward Socerb Castle and park at a sharp left turn (there's plenty of space at the start of a gravel road). Follow the gravel road, take a left turn whenever you feel like it, and you'll eventually get to the Socerb castle and back to your car.

Need more instructions? Here they are:

* Start hiking on the gravel road.
* Take a left turn, following the blue (biking) signs.
* Leave the biking signs and turn left onto a narrower dirt trail at the next fork.
* When the dirt trail reaches the next gravel road, you'll be somewhere close to the halfway point. If you're hiking with small kids, you might want to take a break for a short snack.
* We usually turned left and followed the gravel road toward the castle; you can also go straight until you reach the plateau's edge and the marked Alpe Adria trail.
* Turn left. Follow the hiking (red) signs back to the gravel road and then onto a narrower dirt trail that brings you straight to the Socerb Castle.
* You could take the asphalt road to get back to the car, but it's much better to follow the waymarks and visit Sveta Jama -- a tiny church in a cave.
