## In a Nutshell

* Park at a large parking lot close to [Tourist Farm Kuren](https://prfigarji.si/)
* Take the narrow road toward the farm/St. Nicholas church.
* At the end of the asphalt road, continue straight onto a narrow dirt road, following signs for Planina
* You'll reach the junction with the path from Stara Vrhnika in a few minutes. Keep going straight.
* In 30-45 minutes of easy walking on a well-marked wide footpath, you'll reach the gravel road Zaplana–Planina. Turn left; the mountain hut at Planina is only a short walk away.
* Don't forget to taste *[vrhniški štruklji](https://www.visitvrhnika.si/en/vrhnika/worthy-of-attention/rolled-prune-dumplings)* at the mountain hut, or have a great lunch at the tourist farm Kuren.
