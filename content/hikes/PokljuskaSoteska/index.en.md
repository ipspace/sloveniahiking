description: 'If you happen to be near Bled and love gorges, you could choose between
  going to Vintgar or Pokljuka Gorge. Vintgar looks better (due to the river flowing
  through it), but it''s usually overcrowded, resulting in a Disneyland vibe. If you
  prefer wild habitats, there''s no doubt: visiting Pokljuka Gorge is a must.'
difficulty: Easy hike (but don't try to do it in urban footwear)

{{<hike-details description="yes">}}

**A bit of a warning first**: don't even think about going into the gorge in urban footwear as some overly brave tourists do. Hiking boots are a must, and as you'll be walking around vertical or overhanging rockfaces, a helmet can't hurt.

* Park in a small parking lot at the entrance to the gorge.
* The best way to enjoy the experience is to take the circular trail -- follow the ravine (turn left at the first junction), explore the narrow galleries, and return via Pokljuka Hole[^1].
* We decided to drop by Pokljuka Alp. Just before the trail starts descending toward the cave, take a left turn following white/red hiking signs, and you'll reach the first meadows in a few minutes.

[^1]: An immense shaft with three natural windows and the only way to exit the ravine before the galleries' bridge was built in the 1930s.
