description: Every self-respecting European city has a castle (or, at the very least,
  the castle ruins) on a nearby hill, and Vipava is no exception. Ascending to Vipava's
  Old Castle is a lovely family hike worth combining with phenomenal ice cream at
  Bar Marjanca.

### In a Nutshell

-   Park in a large parking lot just before the town center
-   Walk through Lantieri park to reach the main square.
-   Have a coffee at *Bar pri Marjanci*.
-   At the western edge of the main square, turn right onto Kreljeva ulica.
-   The waymarks start at the next junction. Follow them to a tiny parking lot, then follow signs for "Stari grad" onto a wide, well-maintained gravel footpath.
-   Turn sharp right at the next junction (you can't miss the castle, it's clearly visible from there), and you'll reach your destination in a few minutes.
-   After enjoying the views and exploring the castle ruins, use the same path to return to Vipava or take a long detour via [Plaz](../plaz/).
-   Have a pizza, pasta, or Å¾likrofi at *Picerija na Placu*.
