description: 'Imagine you were living in a small village in the 17th century. How
  would you call the hilltop behind it? If it''s high enough, it''s bound to be The
  Mountain. Fast forward to the times of mass tourism -- the townspeople want to know
  which Mountain they visited when they brag about their weekend trips. Welcome to
  the etymology of Polhograjska Gora (Polhov Gradec Mountain), a lovely hilltop with
  a church of Saint Laurent.

## Notes

* Park near Polhov Gradec Castle and follow the signs for Sveti Lovrenc and ÄŒebelarski Dom (Beekeeper Lodge) toward a bright yellow house at the edge of the village.
* The footpath starts right after that house. You can't miss it -- there's a gigantic bee guarding it.
* In a few moments, you'll reach a stela erected by *some important local person* to commemorate *an even more important person* dropping by to admire [Daphne blagayana](/en/flowers/daphneblagayana/) (you'll find a more serious take on the subject on a panel next to the stela).
* The footpath turns sharp right. Following the (sparse, faded) waymarks for an hour or so will bring you to a saddle with lovely views of the Slovenian Alps.
* Take one of the paths past the wayside shrine -- both of them bring you to the church at the hilltop.
* On the way back, stop at the Museum of Post and Telecommunications in Polhov Gradec Castle -- our kids loved to drop by and play with the old rotary phones.
