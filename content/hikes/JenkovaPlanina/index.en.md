## Three Easy Steps to Get There

* Park at a large parking lot at the end of Ravenska Koƒçna (a glacial side valley east of Jezersko).
* Follow signs for Goli Vrh/Velika Baba onto a gravel road that slowly transforms into an ever-narrower dirt road.
* Watch out for red arrows sending you right onto a wide, steep footpath that will safely bring you to your destination.
* Enjoy the view!
