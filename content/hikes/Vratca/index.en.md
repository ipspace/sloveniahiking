## In a Nutshell

* From [Češka Koča](../ceskakoca/) follow the signs for Kočna/Grintovec
* Take the first fork toward Vratca (later sign: Stara Pot/old way). It's much better to take this trail on the way up.
* Follow the waymarks across loose rocks and precarious scree.
* Enjoy the (semi)climbing experience through the gully and try not to trigger a rockslide.
* Follow an exposed trail to the top.
* Enjoy the view!
* On the way back, follow the most obvious path across the scree -- it's better to deal with loose gravel than rocks on the way down.
