### In a Nutshell

* Start the hike at a roadside parking space just above the hunting hut in Budanje.
* Years ago, there was a sign for Kovk pointing to a dirt trail leading uphill. That sign is long gone, but the dirt trail is impossible to miss.
* The dirt trail morphs into a narrow footpath when it meets the steep slopes of Gora. You'll also notice the first red arrows and waymarks -- follow them to the Gora plateau.
* A bit above the halfway point, you'll get to an impossible-to-miss rock shelter. If you do the hike around Christmas, you might encounter a tiny Nativity scene there.
* Another Nativity scene is waiting for you a few meters before the footpath reaches the edge of the plateau. It was a bit boring the last time I walked by -- everyone left, leaving Mother Mary all alone in front of Bethlehem skyline.
* When you reach Gora's sunny pastures, follow the wider footpath going left toward a paragliding take-off point.
* Take a break and enjoy the view ;)
