## In a Nutshell

* Park at a large parking lot next to Gradišče camp.
* Follow signs for Plaz onto an ascending dirt trail.
* When the trail passes easily-climbable rocks, you might notice red dots on the rocks. If you're reasonably athletic and not afraid of heights, try and climb them -- after approximately 80 m, the climb will end at the marked footpath (warning: not suitable for kids unless you know how to spot or belay them).

* OK, so you're not a climber. When you get to the next fork, [take it](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/07/25/fork-road/). Seriously -- you could take a footpath going right or keep on the rocky trail going left. They will both bring you to a lovely picnic spot in a pine forest.
* From the picnic spot, follow a slowly ascending footpath to the hilltop and enjoy the vista.

Regardless of which path you took to get to Plaz, you can make the trip a bit more interesting by taking the other one to return to Gradišče.
