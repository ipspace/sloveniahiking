## Notes

* Most visitors park near the church of Sveti Kvirik ([Saint Quiricus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyricus_and_Julitta)). That was discouraged in Ye Olde Days, so I always try to park near Gostilna Soƒçerga (starting coordinates).
* If you decide to park at the church, follow the signs for Krog onto a well-marked wide footpath, we'll be with you in a minute. Alternatively, you could walk back to the main road and be with us the whole way.
* Still here? Cross the road and follow the signs for Olika onto a descending dirt trail.
* At the next junction, take the left trail.
* Just before getting back to the asphalt road, take another left trail ascending toward the ridge of Veli Badin (follow a yellow arrow).
* When you reach the marked footpath, turn right (if you parked at the church, now's a good time to continue reading).
* You'll be able to enjoy the fantastic views until you enter a sparse forest. Take a left turn and follow the waymarks onto a descending footpath that eventually brings you to an old abandoned gravel road.
* Turn right onto a footpath just before the trail hits the road, and you'll get to the natural bridge and the rock shelters. Enjoy!
* Want to take a on the way back shortcut? After leaving the rock shelters, follow a yellow arrow onto a narrow ascending rocky footpath that runs along the ridge and eventually merges with the waymarked trail.
* In any case, follow the waymarks all the way to the church of Sveti Kvirik. If you haven't parked there, descend along the asphalt road to get back to your car.
