## Notes

* Park on Planina Stador (Stador Alp)
* Follow the signs for Kobilja Glava toward the mountain hut. The sign just before the mountain hut was totally washed out in November 2021; follow something that looks like a wooden arrow pointing left.
* Eventually, you'll reach the end of the gravel road next to Chalet Astra Montana. Continue onto a narrow footpath.
* The signs try to help you, but you'll need a tiny bit of scouting skills to get to the ridge of Å princa (an almost-invisible bump on the slopes of Kobilja Glava).

After that you can't get lost:

* Follow the ridge to the peak;
* Traverse a tiny saddle to get to the last hut on the alp;
* Follow a well-worn footpath toward the saddle left of an enormous cross on Kobilja Glava.
* When reaching the main ridge of Kobilja Glava, turn right to reach the cross.

## Going for a Longer Hike

Want to go for a longer hike? Starting halfway up the hill will extend your trek for another hour (and add 400 m of altitude gain):

* As you drive toward Stador Alp, you'll notice a bright red mountaineering sign pointing into the woods next to a sharp right hairpin.
* Park right after the hairpin.
* Follow the red sign onto a sparsely-marked footpath that quickly merges with a wide dirt trail. Follow the dirt trail to Stador Alp.
