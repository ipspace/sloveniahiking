### In a Nutshell

* Park in [Podgorje](../../podgorje)
* Follow the waymarks and signs for Slavnik until you reach a fork at the center of the village
* To hike on the steeper footpath, take the narrow steeply-ascending road going left. Continue on the main road (right) if you prefer the leisurely hike on a gravel road.
* Waymarks along the wide footpath will safely guide you through a sparse forest and across sunny meadows to the mountain hut on Slavnik.
* Don't worry about getting lost -- there are dozens of footpaths leading to the top. As long as you're walking on a reasonably-well-trodden ascending trail, you'll get there.
