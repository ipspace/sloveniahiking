description: Goldilocks would love the hike from Prešnica to Slavnik. It's not too
  long nor too short, it's not too steep nor too dull, and it's in a lovely shade,
  but the forest is thin enough to let some winter sunshine through.
difficulty: Easy hours-long hike on a leisurely footpath

### Notes

-   We'll start the hike at a large parking lot behind Prešnica. To get there, follow the red arrows and the signs for Slavnik along the main road through Prešnica, then turn right at the Parking sign.
-   Follow the red signs for Slavnik along the asphalt road, under the railway, onto a gravel road, and finally onto a footpath disappearing into the forest.
-   The waymarks will safely guide you along the path. Stop at a halfway vista point (razgled) with phenomenal views of Slovenian Istria.
-   When you reach the first gravel road, cross it and continue on a dirt trail. Stay on that trail until it ends at a gravel road at the start of expansive meadows just below the peak.
-   Turn left onto the gravel road, and as soon as you spot the radio tower and the mountain hut directly ahead, take any trail leading there.
-   Enjoy the views!

Years ago, I made a mistake and decided to return via Podgorje. The descent to Podgorje was fun; after that, I was "blessed" with an hour of slogging along a gravel road. Never again.
