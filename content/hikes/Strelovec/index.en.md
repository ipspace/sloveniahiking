## Getting There

At least three paths (with a half-dozen variants) lead to Strelovec. Mojca Luštrek wrote a mini-guide describing half of them in Slovenian (the [Google translation](https://sloveniahiking-rocks.translate.goog/hikes/strelovec/?_x_tr_sl=sl&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US) isn't too awful); the easiest way to get there is to:

-   Hike from Logarska Dolina to [Plesnikova Planina](../plesnikovaplanina/)
-   Take the dirt road from Plesnikova Planina to [Icmanikova Planina](../icmanikovaplanina/)
-   Follow the signs for Strelovec onto a narrow footpath ascending into the forest.
-   Follow the waymarks along the easy-to-follow path. Be careful when traversing steep slopes!
-   Turn sharp left when you reach the ridge between Strelovec and Krofička, and follow it until you reach the peak.
-   Use the same path to return to Logarska Dolina or do a roundtrip via Koča na Klemenči Jami.
