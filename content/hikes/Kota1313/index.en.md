### In a Nutshell

-   We were staying at [House Natura](https://www.bovechouse.com/) above Bovec; our hike was thus a bit shorter than yours[^MT]. Follow the [Plajer](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-route/slovenia/plajer-trail/33600440/)- or [Historic (Zgodovinska) Trail](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-route/zgodovinska-pot-historic-trail-/33658792/) from the center of Bovec toward the Plajer homestead high above the valley.
-   From the Plajer homestead, follow the Historic Trail toward [Fort Hermann](https://www.soca-valley.com/en/in-search-of-adventure/culture/2021010610355699/kluze-amp-fort-herman/). After passing Široki Plaz (massive scree with remains of snow avalanches), look for an unmarked footpath going left. You'll find a decrepit sign for Kluže and the "1313" text with a left arrow carved into a tree at the junction.

[^MT]: That also explains why some of the GPX track is missing ;)

{{<note warn>}}The direct footpath toward Kota 1313 is rarely used; following it requires decent pathfinding skills. Its position on OpenStreetMap is fairly precise, but don't forget to download the map in advance; mobile coverage is spotty.{{</note>}}

-   The footpath winds across the steep slopes; it took us approximately an hour to get to Kota 1313.
-   Take a break and enjoy the view ;)

We decided to return via the waymarked path Kluže-Rombon:

-   Follow a footpath going north until you hit the wide trail to Rombon.
-   Turn right and descend toward Kluže until the junction with the History (Zgodovinska) Trail. Turn right (direction Bovec/Široki Plaz).
-   After passing Široki Plaz, follow the Plajer Trail toward Bovec or descend back to the Plajer homestead (like we did) and return to Bovec via the Plajer- or the Historic Trail.
