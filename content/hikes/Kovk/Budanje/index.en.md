## In a Nutshell

* Start the hike from the parking lot above hunting hut in Budanje and hike to Sončnica ([more details](../../soncnica)).
* If needed, take a well-deserved break next to the paragliding take-off point.
* The path toward Kovk starts as a barely-visible footpath forking off the main trail a few meters away from the plateau edge. Follow a sign for Col and waymarks across sunny pastures.
* The hike's last part is yet again a bit steeper but a leisurely walk compared to the Budanje-Sončnica segment.
