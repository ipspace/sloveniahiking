Kovk on Gora (hilly plateau north of Vipava Valley between Predmeja and Col) could mean one of three things:

* The ridge on the eastern side of the plateau
* The highest peak in that ridge (that's the one we're interested in)
* A hamlet near the Col-Predmeja road.

The sunny slopes of Kovk will try to entice you whenever you drive on the road that traces the old Roman road from Hru≈°ica toward Col. Take a break, hike from Col to Kovk (not more than 2 hours), or go for a day-long journey along the edge of Gora plateau.
