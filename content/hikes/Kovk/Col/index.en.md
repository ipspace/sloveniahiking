[Kovk](../) is a scenic hilltop at the edge of the Gora plateau high above [Vipava valley](../../../region/vipava-valley/) with fantastic vistas of the valley, Trnovski Gozd, Julian Alps, and the Italian Dolomites. Getting there from Col (a village at the Gora plateau's eastern edge) is a comfortable hour-long hike with a few steeper sections -- ideal for an afternoon family stroll.

## In a Nutshell

* Park at an enormous parking lot next to the church in Col, or follow signs to Predmeja until the village's end, and park near the recycling bins.
* A few meters after the recycling bins, you'll encounter a red signpost for Pot po Robu (path on edge), sending you left onto a wide dirt road.
* The dirt road slowly narrows into a track. Follow it just past a clearing where a red arrow sends you left.
* After a few meters, you'll encounter another fork: an unmarked footpath goes to the right, the dirt trail goes straight through the forest. Take either one; they'll both bring you to the destination.
* If you chose the footpath (dotted line on the hiking map), you're all set. Follow it till the hilltop.
* If you decided to follow the waymarks on the dirt trail, be careful when you arrive at a small pasture: your path turns left onto an ascending footpath at the end of it. After a few minutes of pretty steep ascent through a sparse beech forest, you'll get to a sunny range and the bench on the hilltop.

Like diversity? Take the other path on the way back:

* If you took the footpath to get to Kovk, follow the waymarks leading into the forest.
* If you followed the marked path, take the trail going straight east (the direction you came from).
