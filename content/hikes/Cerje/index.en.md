description: 'Hiking to Cerje, a hilltop with a fantastic view high above Vipava valley,  was
  fun before it was graced with a gigantic Monument of Peace. Gravel roads got a needless
  coat of asphalt, and the old footpaths turned into wide rocky trails... but if you''re
  creative and take plenty of detours, you can still have a lovely Karst experience.

  '
difficulty: Easy hike across Karst meadows and forests

### Getting There and Back

* Park at the large parking lot next to Miren-Kostanjevica road
* Follow the narrow asphalt road until the first left turn, then take a footpath going right.
* The path will eventually veer toward the left, bringing you to a gravel road.
* At the next signpost, turn sharp left onto a narrow path disappearing into the bushes. Follow it till you get back to the asphalt road.
* Cross the asphalt road and follow the signs for Cerje until you get to the observation tower. Enjoy the views and visit the museum.
* On the way back, watch for a narrow footpath going right. Follow it to a meadow, where it joins with a gravel road.
* Turn right onto the gravel road and turn left after a few meters (direction Miren).
* After passing the high-voltage power lines, turn left onto a dirt trail that will bring you to where you left the asphalt road at the beginning of your hike.
