{{<hike-details>}}

Jampršnik is a barely noticeable peak above the overhanging cliffs of Karst Edge. If you find yourself in Zazid but haven't been to Slovenian Istria before, don't waste time going there; the hike to [Lipnik](../lipnik) or [Kavčič](../kavcic) is infinitely more picturesque. However, if you've visited most of the other peaks along the Karst Edge, Jampršnik might be an attractive alternative destination.

## In a Nutshell

* Park in Zazid and start hiking toward Zazid train station ([details](../lipnik/))
* After crossing the railway tracks, turn left (direction Jampršnik) and follow the dirt road until a red arrow sends you onto a narrow, steep (and slippery) footpath.
* Follow the footpath until you reach the plateau above Karst Edge, then turn left.
* Follow the path above the overhanging cliffs until you reach the peak.

## Going Back

You could use the same trail to return to Zazid or take a detour via Brežec:

* Continue following the marked footpath until it crosses the dirt road, then turn left.
* Follow the dirt road and descend through Brežec. Eventually, you'll reach the Zazid train station.
