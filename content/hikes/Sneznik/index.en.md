## In a Nutshell

* Take the asphalt road from Ilirska Bistrica to reach Sviščaki. Alternatives proposed by Google Maps are "*interesting*."
* Park near the Sviščaki mountain hut (where the waymarks start) or at a large parking lot close to the first cottages in Sviščaki.
* If you parked at the mountain hut, follow the waymarks. If you decided to take the earlier parking lot, follow the gravel road until you hit the waymarks, and turn right.
* A wide footpath will lead you to another gravel road. Turn left, and follow the road until you get to a large table advertising the Snežnik mountain hut. Follow barely-visible waymarks onto an ascending dirt trail (you could keep walking on the gravel road; they merge in ~30 minutes).
* After almost an hour, the well-marked dirt trails lead you to the last gravel road you'll encounter. Take a shortcut through the forest and then follow the road till its end (where the Snežnik Botanical Reserve starts).
* Follow an ever-steeper footpath toward the already-visible mountain hut and the mountaintop.
