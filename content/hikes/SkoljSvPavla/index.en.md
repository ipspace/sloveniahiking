## Getting There and Back

-   Park at the end of Vrtovin village, either next to the local school or at the cemetery.
-   Two paths to Saint Paul (sv. Pavel) start at the school building. Take the western one (the left one when looking at the hills).
-   The signs for "sv. Pavel" will send you onto an asphalt road, footpath, and a dirt trail until you reach broad, well-maintained terraced meadows.
-   Follow a barely visible footpath straight up the meadows until you return to the dirt trail. Turn left.
-   Keep following red blotches and signs for "sv. Pavel" along dirt trails and footpaths until you reach a junction where the signs send you onto both forks. The right path is easier to follow.
-   Cross a wider trail and continue toward the remains of a Roman-era defense tower.
-   A few meters beyond the defense tower ruins is another junction. The right path is so steep that someone thought it needed a steel cable to help you; the left is relatively leisurely and brings you straight to the church.
-   If you take the right path, you'll quickly get to the edge of the terrace and a lovely vista point. Take a break and enjoy the views, then follow the footpath along the terrace edge till you reach the church.
