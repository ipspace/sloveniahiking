No, you won't find the beautiful flowers you can buy at the florist growing around Slovenia. The closest you'd get would be [daylilies](../hemerocallis) but they aren't even lilies...

There are four species of wild lilies growing in Slovenia:

* [Martagon lily](../../liliummartagon/) in shady spots like subalpine forests
* [Golden apple](../../liliumcarniolicum/) in alpine meadows
* [Orange lily](../../liliumbulbiferum/) in warm meadows of south-western Slovenia
* Another variant subspecies of orange lily (or is it a separate species? Ask three botanists and get five answers), *Lilium croceum / Lilium bulbiferum var. croceum*, grows only on Sne≈ænik.
